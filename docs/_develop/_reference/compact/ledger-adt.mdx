## Kernel

This ADT is a special ADT defining various built-in operations and valid only as a top-level ADT type.

### blockTimeGreaterThan

```compact
blockTimeGreaterThan(time: Uint<64>): Boolean
```

Checks whether the current block time (measured in seconds since the Unix epoch) is greater than the given amount.

### blockTimeLessThan

```compact
blockTimeLessThan(time: Uint<64>): Boolean
```

Checks whether the current block time (measured in seconds since the Unix epoch) is less than the given amount.

### checkpoint

```compact
checkpoint(): []
```

Marks all execution up to this point as being a single atomic unit, allowing partial transaction failures to be split across it.

### claimContractCall

```compact
claimContractCall(addr: Bytes<32>, entry_point: Bytes<32>, comm: Field): []
```

Require the presence of another contract call in the containing transaction, with a match address, entry point hash, and communication commitment, that is not claimed by any other call.

### claimZswapCoinReceive

```compact
claimZswapCoinReceive(note: Bytes<32>): []
```

Requires the presence of a commitment in the containing transaction and that no other call claims it as a receive.

### claimZswapCoinSpend

```compact
claimZswapCoinSpend(note: Bytes<32>): []
```

Requires the presence of a commitment in the containing transaction and that no other call claims it as a spend.

### claimZswapNullifier

```compact
claimZswapNullifier(nul: Bytes<32>): []
```

Requires the presence of a nullifier in the containing transaction and that no other call claims it.

### mint

```compact
mint(domain_sep: Bytes<32>, amount: Uint<64>): []
```

Mints a given amount of shielded coins with a token type derived from the contract's address, and a given domain separator.

Returns the current contract's address.  ContractAddress is defined in CompactStandardLibrary.

## Cell\<value_type>

This ADT is a single Cell containing a value of type value_type and is used implicitly when the ledger field type is an ordinary Compact type. Programmers cannot write Cell explicitly when declaring a ledger field..

### read

```compact

Returns the current contents of this Cell.

*available from Typescript as a getter on the ledger field*
