# Quick start

This quick start guide helps you jumpstart your developer experience with Midnight. If you're well versed in zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies and Web3 development, follow the steps below.

For detailed explanations of each step, refer to the [Midnight developer tutorial](/develop/tutorial/using/).

:::note
The Midnight wallet has only been tested with the Google Chrome browser. We recommend using Chrome for the best experience.
:::

1. You must be running macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL); see the [supported platforms](../develop/tutorial/using) details.
2. Install Midnight Lace:
	- Go to the [Midnight Lace wallet releases page](../../relnotes/lace).
	- Select the required version according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/comp-matrix).
	- Click **ZIP Archive** under **Artifacts** to download the archive.
	- In the Google Chrome browser, go to **Settings > Extensions**.
	- Enter developer mode by enabling the **Developer mode** toggle on the top right corner of the extensions page.
	- Click the **Load unpacked** button and select the unzip folder for the Midnight Lace wallet:

3. [Set up the Midnight Lace](../develop/tutorial/using/chrome-ext) by opening the wallet extension and setting up a new wallet address.
4. Request and receive tDUST from the [Midnight testnet faucet ðŸš°](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/).
5. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your Linux, Mac, or Windows device.
6. Install and run the **proof server**:

- On your terminal or PowerShell, download the Docker image for the Midnight proof server by running the following command:

```
docker pull midnightnetwork/proof-server:<VERSION>
```

  Replace `<VERSION>` with the required version of the proof server according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/comp-matrix).

- Run the proof server with the following command:

```
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

7. Test your setup by sending some tDUST to a friend:

- Copy your friend's `receive` wallet address (your friend can get it by clicking the **receive** button, see image below). Alternatively, copy Carl's address below, and send exactly 1.0 tDUST.

```

```

:::note Address Format Reminder
The example address above uses the legacy HEX format. If you're copying a receiving address from the Midnight Lace wallet (v2.0.0+), it will be in Bech32m format by default. For example: `mn_shield-addr_test12ctc3mzcs9ajphcprx70k8v7fpv6t370czywvzzlg3jvzu5qa6xqxqpk0ww7xu9hf8dy28jfymkn6eegfee7pemfjgl0pj4pv982l46qv6ffflksfy7cnw4q08xvakqa7ur38nrgepwzgrck9qcaxz`
