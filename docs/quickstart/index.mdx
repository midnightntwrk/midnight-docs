# Quick start

This quick start guide helps you jumpstart your developer experience with Midnight. If you're well versed in zero-knowledge (ZK) technologies and Web3 development, follow the steps below.

For detailed explanations of each step, refer to the [Midnight developer tutorial](/develop/tutorial/using/).

:::note
The Midnight wallet has only been tested with the Google Chrome browser. We recommend using Chrome for the best experience.
:::

1. You must be running macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL); see the [supported platforms](../develop/tutorial/using) details.
2. Install Lace from [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg).
3. [Set up Lace](../develop/tutorial/using/chrome-ext) by opening the wallet extension and setting up a new wallet address.
4. Request and receive tDUST from the [Midnight testnet faucet ðŸš°](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/).
5. Download and install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for your Linux, Mac, or Windows device.
6. Install and run the **proof server**:

- On your terminal or PowerShell, download the Docker image for the Midnight proof server by running the following command:

```
docker pull midnightnetwork/proof-server:<VERSION>
```

  Replace `<VERSION>` with the required version of the proof server according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/comp-matrix).

- Run the proof server with the following command:

```
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

7. Test your setup by sending some tDUST to a friend:

- Copy your friend's `receive` wallet address (your friend can get it by clicking the **receive** button, see image below). Alternatively, copy Carl's address below, and send exactly 1.0 tDUST.

```
mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9
```

:::note Address Format Reminder
The example address above uses the legacy HEX format. If you're copying a receiving address from the Lace wallet, it will be in Bech32m format by default. For example: `mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9`

Now you're all set to proceed!

In [Part 1 of this developer tutorial](/develop/tutorial/using/), you'll discover detailed explanations for each step above. Please refer to them if you encounter any issues along the way.

To launch your first DApp, see [Part 2: building a DApp](/develop/tutorial/building/).
