:::


## Set up the environment 

### Install Lace wallet

Install and prepare the Lace wallet extension for Midnight development.

1. Open Google Chrome browser
2. Navigate to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg)
3. Click "Add to Chrome"
4. Confirm the installation by clicking "Add extension"

**Verification**: The Lace wallet icon appears in your Chrome toolbar.


### Configure your wallet

Set up your Midnight wallet with a secure address and backup.

1. Click the Lace wallet icon in your browser toolbar
2. Select "Create a new wallet"
3. Follow the wallet setup guide to:
   - Generate a new wallet address
   - **Securely store your seed phrase** (write it down offline)
   - Set a strong wallet password
4. Complete the wallet verification process

**Verification**: Your wallet dashboard displays a balance of 0 tDUST and shows your wallet address.

:::warning Seed phrase security
Your seed phrase is the master key to your wallet. Store it securely offline and never share it with anyone. Loss of your seed phrase means permanent loss of wallet access.
:::


### Get testnet tokens

Obtain tDUST tokens for testing transactions on the Midnight Testnet.

1. Copy your wallet's receive address from the Lace wallet
2. Open the [Midnight testnet faucet](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/)
3. Paste your wallet address into the faucet form
4. Submit the faucet request
5. Wait for the transaction to confirm (typically 1-5 minutes)

**Verification**: Your Lace wallet shows a balance of tDUST tokens.

:::tip Testnet tokens
tDUST tokens are required for testing transactions on the Midnight Testnet. These have no real-world value and are used solely for development purposes.
:::


### Install Docker Desktop

Install Docker Desktop to run the Midnight proof server.

1. Visit the [Docker Desktop download page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
2. Select your operating system (Linux, Mac, or Windows)
3. Download the installer
4. Run the installer with administrator privileges
5. Follow the installation wizard
6. Restart your computer if prompted
7. Launch Docker Desktop and complete the initial setup

**Verification**: 
- Docker Desktop runs (check system tray/menu bar)
- Open terminal/PowerShell and run: `docker --version`
- You see Docker version information



### Set up the proof server

Download and run the Midnight proof server for zero-knowledge proof generation.

The proof server is essential for zero-knowledge proof generation in Midnight applications.

#### Download the Docker image

1. Open your terminal or PowerShell
2. Run the following command:

```bash
docker pull midnightnetwork/proof-server:<VERSION>
```

:::caution Version compatibility
Replace `<VERSION>` with the required version according to the [release compatibility matrix](/relnotes/comp-matrix). Using an incompatible version causes issues.
:::

**Verification**: The Docker image downloads successfully without errors.

#### Run the proof server

1. In your terminal, execute:

```bash
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

2. Keep this terminal window open - the proof server must remain running
3. You see startup logs indicating the server is ready

**Verification**: 
- The proof server displays "Server listening on port 6300"
- No error messages appear in the terminal

:::info Port configuration
The proof server runs on port 6300. Ensure this port is available on your system and not blocked by firewall settings.
:::

### Test your setup

Verify your complete setup by performing a test transaction.

Choose one of the following options to test your transaction flow:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="friend" label="Send to friend" default>

Send tDUST to a friend:

1. Ask a friend to share their Lace wallet receive address.
2. Have them open their Lace wallet and click the **Receive**.
3. Copy their wallet address.
4. Open your Lace wallet and click **Send**.
5. Paste your friend's address as the recipient.
6. Enter any amount of tDUST (recommended: 0.5-2.0 tDUST).
7. Review the transaction details.
8. Confirm and submit the transaction.
9. Wait for confirmation (1-5 minutes).

**Verification**: 
- Your friend receives the tDUST in their wallet
- Both wallets show the transaction in their history
- Your wallet balance decreases by the sent amount plus fees

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="test" label="Send to test address">

Send to a test address:

1. Copy the test address below:
   ```
   mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9
   ```
2. Open your Lace wallet and click **Send**.
3. Paste the address as the recipient.
4. Enter exactly **1.0 tDUST** for testing.
5. Review the transaction details carefully.
6. Confirm and submit the transaction.
7. Wait for confirmation (1-5 minutes).

**Verification**: 
- Transaction completes successfully.
- Your wallet balance decreases by 1.0 tDUST plus fees.
- Transaction appears in your wallet history.

:::info Test address benefits
Using the test address allows you to test the transaction flow without needing a friend's address. This is perfect for solo development setup verification.
:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

**General transaction steps** (applies to both options):
1. Open your Lace wallet.
2. Click **Send**.
3. Paste the recipient address.
4. Enter the amount.
5. Review the transaction details.
6. Confirm and submit the transaction.
7. Wait for confirmation (1-5 minutes).

:::warning Address format
The example address above uses the **legacy HEX format**. 

If you're copying a receiving address from the Lace wallet, it displays in **Bech32m format** by default. For example:
```
mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9
```
