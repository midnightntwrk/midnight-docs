- [ ] No broken internal references
- [ ] Mobile view looks good


## Style guide

Follow the [style guidelines](/contribute/style-guide) to maintain consistency across the documentation.


### Add a new page

1. **Determine the section** - Where does this fit?
2. **Create the file** - Use kebab-case naming
3. **Add frontmatter** (if required by your framework)
4. **Write the content** - Follow the style guide
5. **Update navigation** - Add links to/from the page
6. **Test locally** - Verify everything works


### Add a new section

2. Add an `index.md` overview page
3. Update the main `index.md` to link to the new section
4. Update the site navigation configuration


## Verified commits required

All pull requests to Midnight documentation must use verified commits. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of contributions.


### What are verified commits?

Verified commits are cryptographically signed to prove they came from you. They provide the following:

- **Security** - Prevents impersonation and unauthorized changes
- **Authenticity** - Proves commits come from the claimed author
- **Trust** - Builds confidence in the contribution chain
- **Compliance** - Meets security requirements for open source projects


### Set up commit signing

You can sign commits using GPG. GPG is the most common method.

#### GPG signing

**Step 1: Generate a GPG key**

   ```bash
   # Generate a new GPG key
   gpg --full-generate-key

   # When prompted:
   # - Choose RSA and RSA (default)
   # - Use at least 4096 bits
   # - Set expiration (1 year recommended)
   # - Enter your name and email (must match GitHub email)
   ```

**Step 2: Get your GPG key ID**

   ```bash
   # List your GPG keys
   gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

   # Output will look like:
   # sec   rsa4096/3AA5C34371567BD2 2024-01-01 [SC]
   # Your key ID is: 3AA5C34371567BD2
   ```

**Step 3: Export your public key**

   ```bash
   # Export the public key (replace YOUR_KEY_ID)
   gpg --armor --export YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```

**Step 4: Add the key to GitHub**

   1. Copy the entire GPG key, including `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----` and `-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`
   2. Go to GitHub Settings → [SSH and GPG keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   3. Click **New GPG key**
   4. Paste your public key
   5. Click **Add GPG key**

**Step 5: Configure Git to sign commits**

   ```bash
   # Tell Git to use your GPG key (replace YOUR_KEY_ID)
   git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID

   # Sign all commits by default
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true

   # For Windows, you may need to set the GPG program
   git config --global gpg.program "C:\Program Files (x86)\GnuPG\bin\gpg.exe"
   ```

**Step 6: Test signing**

   ```bash
   # Make a test commit
   git commit -S -m "Test signed commit"

   # Verify it's signed
   git log --show-signature -1
   ```

### Sign commits in your PR

Once configured, your commits will be automatically signed.

**Making a signed commit:**

   ```bash
   # If you set commit.gpgsign true, all commits are signed automatically
   git commit -m "Fix typo in wallet guide"

   # Or manually sign individual commits
   git commit -S -m "Fix typo in wallet guide"
   ```

**Signing existing commits:**

If you already made commits without signing, you can re-sign them:

   ```bash
   # Re-sign the last commit
   git commit --amend --no-edit -S

   # Re-sign multiple commits (interactive rebase)
   git rebase -i HEAD~3 --signoff
   # In the editor, change 'pick' to 'edit' for commits to sign
   # Then for each commit:
   git commit --amend --no-edit -S
   git rebase --continue
   ```

**Force push the signed commits:**

   ```bash
   git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch-name
   ```

### Verify your commits on GitHub

After pushing, verify your commits are signed.

**Troubleshooting unverified commits:**

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Email mismatch | Ensure your Git email matches your GitHub email: `git config user.email` |
| Key not added to GitHub | Add your GPG/SSH key to GitHub Settings |
| Key expired | Generate a new key or extend expiration |
| `gpg: signing failed` | Ensure GPG agent is running: `gpgconf --launch gpg-agent` |
| Wrong key format | Verify you're using GPG or SSH format correctly |

## Community Hub

Midnight uses the [Community Hub](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/community-hub) to manage community-driven contributions across all projects, including documentation.

### What is the Community Hub?

The Community Hub is a collaborative platform that uses GitHub's built-in features (issues, projects, and automations) to efficiently triage ideas and turn them into actionable tasks.

**Use the Community Hub for:**
- **Content proposals** - Suggesting new articles, tutorials, or educational resources
- **Feature requests** - Proposing enhancements for tools and processes
- **Bug reports** - Reporting defects or unexpected behavior
- **dApp proposals** - Sharing visions for new decentralized applications

### How the workflow works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Your Idea"] --> B["Community Board (Triage)"]
    B --> C["Grab n' Go Board (Development)"]
    C --> D["Done!"]
```

#### Stage 1: Community Board (Triage)

All new issues land here for initial review. The triage committee reviews for validity, clarity, and priority.

**Issue statuses:**
- **New** - Submitted and awaiting review
- **In Triage** - Being actively reviewed by the committee
- **Needs Discussion** - Requires more feedback or clarification
- **Rejected** - Out of scope or invalid (with explanation provided)

Once approved, issues get a `triaged` label and automatically move to the next stage.

#### Stage 2: Grab n' Go Board (Development)

This board contains approved, ready-to-work-on tasks - the community's backlog!

**Issue statuses:**
- **Ready** - Waiting for a contributor to claim (look for `good-first-issue` labels!)
- **In Progress** - A contributor is actively working on it
- **Done** - Complete and automatically closed when linked PR is merged

### Choose the right issue template

The Community Hub provides several templates to help categorize submissions:

| Template | Use for | Label applied |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Content Proposal | New articles, tutorials, educational resources | `content` |
| Feature Request | New features or enhancements | `enhancement` |
| Bug Report | Defects, errors, unexpected behavior | `bug` |
| dApp Proposal | New dApps, integrations, improvements | `dapp-idea` |

**For documentation contributions specifically:**
- **Small fixes** (typos, clarifications) → Create PR directly in [midnight-docs](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-docs)
- **New content ideas** → Use Community Hub's Content Proposal template
- **Documentation bugs** → Use Community Hub's Bug Report template
- **Major restructuring** → Use Community Hub's Feature Request template
