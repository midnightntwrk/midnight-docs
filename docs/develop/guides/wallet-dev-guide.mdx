# Midnight wallet - developer guide

There are many flavors of wallet software - browser extensions, wallets used in various backend systems, CLI apps, wallets integrated into testing environments, etc. In Midnight, they all need to implement common functionalities, like:
- deriving keys
- deriving token balance from chain data
- managing coins and data needed to generate necessary zero-knowledge proofs
- managing connection with an indexer instance
- creating token transfers and balancing transactions (i.e. paying fees for a contract call), including proof generation requests

It all, to implement robustly, is a non-trivial amount of work. For that reason, there are a couple of packages available to help with integration of wallet functionality:
- `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-api` - high-level wallet interfaces, target abstraction to be used by code utilizing wallet functionality (e.g. browser extension implementation);
- `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet` - implementation of the `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-api`, with some additional tools and helpers
- `@midnight-ntwrk/zswap` - reference implementation of building blocks of [Zswap](/learn/understanding-midnights-technology/zswap)
- `@midnight-ntwrk/dapp-connector-api` - description of the API meant to be injected by browser extensions to enable DApp connections.
- `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-hd` - provides support for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet.
- `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-address-format` - provides support for bech32m address format, allows parsing from to/hex.

## Installing

The Midnight wallet SDK is provided as an NPM package `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet`. 

:::important
Version 4.0.0 introduces several breaking changes! Ensure you are referencing the correct version as defined in the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/comp-matrix).
:::

You can install it using any node package manager, including Yarn. To install the package using Yarn, run the following command:

`yarn add @midnight-ntwrk/wallet/<VERSION>`

Replace `<VERSION>` with the required version of the wallet SDK according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/comp-matrix).


## Important information

The wallet SDK uses the `@midnight-ntwrk/zswap` library to manage its local state and construct transactions. The serialization format, which ensures transactions are processed correctly depending on the network (eg, TestNet or MainNet) they belong to, relies on the [`NetworkId`](../reference/midnight-api/zswap/enumerations/NetworkId.md) provided when building the wallet.

As of version 4.0.0, secret keys are no longer included in the serialized wallet state. If you're restoring a wallet from a serialized snapshot, you must also provide the associated seed. Ensure that sensitive data is securely managed and not stored in snapshots.

---

## Managing wallet SDK instances

The `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet` package offers a builder that enables you to create wallets in various ways. Once created and started, each wallet will automatically connect to the specified node for submitting transactions, indexer for state synchronization, and proving server for generation of zero-knowledge proofs.

To create a wallet instance, begin by importing the builder from the `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet` package:

```ts
import { WalletBuilder } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet';
```

Next, the builder can be used to build instances:
- From a seed
- From a serialized state snapshot (requires the original seed)

:::important
As of version 4.0.0, the `.build()` method requires an explicit seed parameter. The `.buildFromSeed()` method is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
:::

### Creating instance from a seed

The wallet builder offers a method that enables you to instantiate a wallet with a specific seed, resulting in obtaining the same address and keys but with a fresh state that is then synchronized with the indexer. The method requires the following parameters (in the exact order):

| Name | Data type | Required? | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Indexer URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Indexer WebSocket URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Proving server URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Node URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Seed** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Network ID** | NetworkId | Yes | N/A|
| **Log level** | LogLevel  | No | warn |
| **Discard Transaction History** | Boolean  | No | false |


```ts
import { WalletBuilder } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet';
import { NetworkId } from '@midnight-ntwrk/zswap';

const wallet = await WalletBuilder.build(
  'https://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql', // Indexer URL
  'wss://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql/ws', // Indexer WebSocket URL
  'http://localhost:6300', // Proving Server URL
  'https://rpc.testnet-02.midnight.network', // Node URL
  '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  NetworkId.TestNet,
  'error' // LogLevel
);
```

### Creating a random, disposable instance

Starting from version 4.0.0, you must provide a seed when creating a wallet instance. The concept of ephemeral wallets (without seed) is deprecated.

This requires the following parameters (in the precise order):

| Name | Data type | Required? | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Indexer URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Indexer WebSocket URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Proving server URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Node URL** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Seed** | String  | Yes | N/A|
| **Network ID** | NetworkId | Yes | N/A|
| **Log level** | LogLevel  | No | warn |
| **Discard Transaction History** | Boolean  | No | false |



```ts
import { WalletBuilder } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet';
import { NetworkId } from '@midnight-ntwrk/zswap';

import { generateRandomSeed } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-hd';

const randomSeed = generateRandomSeed();

const wallet = await WalletBuilder.build(
  'https://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql', // Indexer URL
  'wss://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql/ws', // Indexer WebSocket URL
  'http://localhost:6300', // Proving Server URL
  'https://rpc.testnet-02.midnight.network',  // Node URL
  randomSeed,
  NetworkId.TestNet,
  'error'
);
```

### State snapshots

The wallet state can be serialized for later restoration. This is especially useful in environments like browser extensions or mobile apps, where you want to quickly restore a user's wallet without full resynchronization from genesis.

To create a snapshot of the current wallet state, use the `serialize()` method.

As of version 4.0.0, secret keys are no longer included in the serialized state. To restore a wallet, you must also provide the original seed used to create it.

To create a wallet instance from the serialized state use method `WalletBuilder.restore`. This method requires the following parameters (in the precise order):

| Name | Data type | Required? | Default |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Indexer URL** | String  | Yes | N/A |
| **Indexer WebSocket URL** | String  | Yes | N/A |
| **Proving server URL** | String  | Yes | N/A |
| **Node URL** | String  | Yes | N/A |
| **Serialized state** | String  | Yes | N/A |
| **Log level** | LogLevel  | No | warn |
| **Discard Transaction History** | Boolean  | No | false |

Note that this builder method doesn't provide a network ID parameter, because it is stored in the serialized snapshot.

The example below shows how to prepare a state snapshot and later restore wallet from it:

```ts
import { WalletBuilder } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet';

const originalWallet = await WalletBuilder.build(/* ... */);
// Start, sync, and use the wallet...

const serializedState = await originalWallet.serialize();

const restoredWallet = await WalletBuilder.restore(
  'https://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql', // Indexer URL
  'wss://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql/ws', // Indexer WebSocket URL
  'http://localhost:6300', // Proving Server URL
  'https://rpc.testnet-02.midnight.network', // Node URL
  '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000', // seed associated with serializedState
  serializedState,
  'error'
);
```

## Wallet instance lifecycle

Creating a wallet does only initialize its internal state.

To begin synchronizing the wallet with the indexer, use the `start()` method on wallet instance:

```ts
 wallet.start();
```

To gracefully close a wallet instance, use the `close()` method:

```ts
await wallet.close();
```

Returned promise will resolve after all resources used for synchronization are released.

## Accessing the wallet state

The [wallet state](/develop/reference/midnight-api/wallet-api/type-aliases/WalletState) is provided through an `rx.js` observable. You can operate on the state value using various operators supported by `rx.js`. The simplest use is to simply log the state upon each change:

```ts
wallet.state().subscribe((state) => {
  console.log(state);
});
```

## Working with transactions

Conceptually, preparing a transaction and submitting it to network is done in 3 steps:
1. Prepare an unproven transaction - outline of transaction to be created
2. Compute needed zero-knowledge proofs and convert outline into the final transaction
3. Submit the transaction

:::note

It is important to ensure that wallet's synchronization progress has reached the tip of the chain before preparing a transaction. Otherwise, there is a very likely possibility of spending a coin, which was already spent, but wallet instance has not learned that fact yet, and in turn - node rejecting the transaction because of detected double spend attempt.

:::

### Preparing transaction - making a transfer

The wallet API includes a `transferTransaction()` method that enables you to construct transactions specifying the token type, amount, and recipient address.

This method requires an array of objects containing the following properties:

| Name | Data type | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **amount** | BigInt  | Yes |
| **type** | TokenType | Yes |
| **receiverAddress** | Address | Yes |


Below, you can see an example of how you can utilize the API:

```ts
import { nativeToken } from '@midnight-ntwrk/zswap';

const transferRecipe = await wallet.transferTransaction([
  {
    amount: 1n,
    receiverAddress: '<midnight-wallet-address>',
    type: nativeToken() // tDUST token type
  }
]);
```

### Preparing transaction - balancing an existing transaction

Balancing an existing transaction is particularly useful, when working with DApps or complementing a swap. It is a process, where transaction is inspected for imbalances between values of provided inputs and outputs, and then a complementary transaction is created, which provides or extracts value (by adding inputs or outputs) needed to pay fees and reduce imbalances. It can be done with `balanceTransaction` method, which requires the following parameters:

| Name | Data type | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **transaction** | Transaction  | Yes |
| **newCoins** | CoinInfo[]  | No |

:::note

The `newCoins` parameter is intended for cases where a new coin is created, such as when a DApp mints one and intends to send it to the wallet. Due to the nature of the Midnight TestNet, these newly created coins must be explicitly provided to the wallet using this method. This allows the wallet to monitor and incorporate them into its state effectively.

:::

```ts
const balancedRecipe = await wallet.balanceTransaction(transaction);
```

### Proving a transaction

Once unproven transaction is ready - it can be proven. Wallet does wrap the results of `transferTransaction` and `balanceTransaction` into objects called `ProvingRecipe` - they allow passing the results of these methods directly to `proveTransaction` method, without conditional logic between to decide what exactly needs to be proven and merged. It takes following parameters:

| Name | Data type | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **provingRecipe** | ProvingRecipe  | Yes |


For example, the `transferRecipe` created [above](#preparing-transaction---making-a-transfer) has a following shape and can be proven like below:

```ts
import { TRANSACTION_TO_PROVE } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-api';

const recipe = {
  type: TRANSACTION_TO_PROVE, // available from the Wallet API
  transaction: anUnprovenTransferTransaction // this is a balanced, unproven transaction
};

const provenTransaction = await wallet.proveTransaction(recipe);
```

:::note

Computing zero-knowledge proofs is a very computationally heavy operation. For that reason one needs to expect that calls to `proveTransaction` take tens of seconds. This is also reason why a proving server is needed at this moment - running native code makes the zero-knowledge technology feasible to use in Midnight.

:::


### Submitting a transaction

Once final, proven transaction is created, it can be submitted. To submit a transaction, you need to use the `submitTransaction` method, which requires the following parameters:

| Name | Data type | Required? |
|---|---|---|
| **transaction** | Transaction  | Yes |


The transaction must be balanced (value of tokens in inputs needs to be at least equal to value of tokens in output, as well as cover fees) and proven for it to be accepted by the node.

The example below uses the `provenTransaction` from the section above:

```ts
const submittedTransaction = await wallet.submitTransaction(provenTransaction);
```

## Connecting to a DApp

See the [DApp connector overview](/develop/reference/midnight-api/dapp-connector/) and [Wallet Provider](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-types/interfaces/WalletProvider) for more details. The former is the API expected to be injected by a browser extension wallet, the latter is interface used by Midnight.js to interact with wallet.

## Examples

In this section, you'll find examples of how you can fully utilize the wallet APIs.

### Transferring tDUST

This example instantiates a new wallet and uses it to transfer one tDUST to another wallet:

```ts
import { WalletBuilder } from '@midnight-ntwrk/wallet';
import { NetworkId, nativeToken } from '@midnight-ntwrk/zswap';

try {
  const wallet = await WalletBuilder.build(
    'https://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql',
    'wss://indexer.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql/ws',
    'http://localhost:6300',
    'https://rpc.testnet-02.midnight.network',
    '0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
    NetworkId.TestNet
  );

  wallet.start();

  const transferRecipe = await wallet.transferTransaction([
    {
      amount: 1n,
      type: nativeToken(),
      receiverAddress: 'mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9' // Example Bech32m address
    }
  ]);

  const provenTransaction = await wallet.proveTransaction(transferRecipe);
  const submittedTransaction = await wallet.submitTransaction(provenTransaction);

  console.log('Transaction submitted:', submittedTransaction);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
}
```
