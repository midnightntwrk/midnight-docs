# How Midnight works

This section provides an overview of how Midnight functions, starting with 
an overview of Midnight's approach to smart contracts, why this
approach is useful, and how to make it work for you. It then goes into technical
details of what Midnight's blockchain does, detailing the shape of transactions,
ledger states, and the semantics of transactions on Midnight.

Midnight currently functions on Testnet. Features may be added, removed, or revised at any time.
