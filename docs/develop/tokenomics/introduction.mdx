# Tokenomics overview

The Midnight tokenomics initiative is built around a dual-token system: **NIGHT** and **DUST**. This structure is designed to balance privacy, predictability, and usability for everyone in the ecosystem, from everyday wallet users to advanced DApp developers.


## What is Tokenomics?

In simple terms, tokenomics describes how value moves through Midnight. It defines how transactions are paid for, how resources are allocated fairly, and how incentives sustain the network over time.  

Unlike many other blockchains, Midnight separates *value transfer* from *resource consumption*.  
This separation makes it possible to transact privately while still giving developers a predictable way to estimate and manage costs.


## NIGHT and DUST explained

**NIGHT** is the transparent, transferable token of the Midnight network.  It is used for payments, staking rewards, and governance. Think of it as the currency of the ecosystem.  

**DUST**, is not a currency.  It is a non-transferable resource token consumed whenever a transaction is executed. Holding NIGHT allows you to generate DUST. Because DUST gradually decays, it cannot be stockpiled indefinitely. This design choice that encourages ongoing participation rather than speculation.


## Why a dual-token architecture?

Most blockchains rely on a single token for both value and fees. This creates several problems: fee amounts can leak metadata, user costs fluctuate with market volatility, and privacy-first designs often compromise on usability.  

Midnight addresses these issues by assigning different responsibilities to each token. NIGHT carries value, while DUST fuels execution. By separating the two, Midnight offers stable and private transaction fees, while maintaining a developer-friendly environment that supports composability and long-term sustainability.
