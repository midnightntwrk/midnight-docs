# Remove excess registrations

Remove extra or invalid registration UTxOs so a single, valid mapping remains for your Cardano wallet to Midnight DUST address.

## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet with multiple registration UTxOs (or an invalid one) at the mapping validator  
- Access to tooling (DApp or CLI/SDK) that can:
  - list registration UTxOs (with timestamp and mapped DUST address)
  - build and submit Cardano transactions that spend selected registration UTxOs

## Steps

### List existing registration UTxOs
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the observability/status layer for your walletâ€™s registration UTxOs, including timestamp and mapped DUST address.</Step>
  <Step>Identify the latest intended registration you want to keep (usually the most recent by timestamp with the correct DUST address).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Select registrations to remove
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Choose the extra or invalid registration UTxOs to remove.</Step>
  <Step>Caution: Do not select the registration you want to keep; spending it will deregister the wallet unless a new mapping is created in the same transaction.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Spend the selected registration UTxOs (one-by-one if needed)
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that spends a selected registration UTxO (no replacement mapping output).</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit; record the <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
  <Step>If there are multiple excess registrations, repeat this step for each. (Each may require a separate transaction.)</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the spent registration UTxOs and relays changes.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates internal state to reflect that only the latest valid registration remains.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm a single valid registration remains
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query status: exactly one registration UTxO should be present for this wallet, with the intended DUST address.</Step>
  <Step>From now on, new cNIGHT UTxOs received by the wallet produce DUST according to the remaining mapping.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
