# Register for DUST production

This tutorial links your Cardano wallet to a Midnight DUST address so that new tokens you receive begin producing DUST.


## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet
- Midnight DUST address that should receive DUST


## Steps

### Provide the two addresses

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Collect your Cardano wallet address (producer) and Midnight DUST address (recipient).</Step>
  <Step>Provide them via one of: <em>DApp registration flow</em>, <em>Glacier Drop redemption</em>, or <em>CLI/SDK</em>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>


### Check whether you’re already registered

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Verify there is no valid registration UTxO already associated with the Cardano wallet as duplicates must be rejected.</Step>
</StepsProvider>


### Create the mapping UTxO on Cardano

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Construct a transaction that produces a UTxO at the mapping validator with a datum mapping <code>CardanoAddress</code> to <code>DUSTAddress</code> (inline datum per CIP-0032 acceptable).</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit.</Step>
  <Step>Keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>


### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the registration UTxO on Cardano and relays the mapping.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates its internal list of registered wallets and validity.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm you’re registered

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The wallet appears as registered (with the mapped DUST address) via the node API.</Step>
  <Step>From now on, any new cNIGHT UTxOs received by that Cardano wallet will generate DUST to the mapped Midnight address.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
