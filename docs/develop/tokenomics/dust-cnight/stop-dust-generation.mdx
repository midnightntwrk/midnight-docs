# Stop DUST generation from specific UTxOs

After deregistration, **already-generating NIGHT UTxOs (on Cardano)** continue generating DUST **until they’re spent**.  
Use this procedure when you need those UTxOs to **stop generating immediately** (e.g., for operational, accounting, or policy reasons).

## Prerequisites

- The wallet has been **deregistered** (no active registration UTxO).
- Access to tooling (DApp or CLI/SDK) that can:
  - list generating UTxOs post-deregistration
  - build and submit a Cardano transaction spending selected UTxOs

## Steps

### Identify generating UTxOs post-deregistration
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the observability/indexer for your wallet’s NIGHT UTxOs and filter those still marked <strong>generating</strong> after deregistration.</Step>
  <Step>Record the UTxO references you intend to deactivate.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Spend the selected UTxOs to terminate generation
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that <strong>spends</strong> the selected generating UTxOs (e.g., return tokens to your own address or consolidate into a new output).</Step>
  <Step>Include required ADA for multi-asset outputs and preserve token balances as desired.</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit the transaction; keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and ledger update
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the spent UTxOs and any newly created outputs.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates ledger/state so DUST generation for the spent UTxOs is ended.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm generation has stopped
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Re-query status: the previously generating UTxOs should appear as <strong>spent</strong> and <strong>no longer producing</strong>.</Step>
  <Step><strong>Final state:</strong> any new UTxOs created by this spend (under a deregistered wallet) are <strong>non-producing</strong>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
