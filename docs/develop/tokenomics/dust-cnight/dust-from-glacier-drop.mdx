# Begin DUST production from Glacier Drop

Initialize DUST generation during your cNIGHT redemption so claimed tokens (and all future cNIGHT you receive) start producing DUST.

## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet eligible for Glacier Drop redemption  
- Midnight DUST address that should receive DUST  
- No conflicting existing registration for this Cardano wallet

## Steps

### Provide the two addresses

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Collect your Cardano wallet address (claim recipient) and Midnight DUST address (DUST recipient).</Step>
  <Step>Provide them as part of the <em>Glacier Drop redemption</em> flow (or an equivalent CLI/SDK flow that builds the same transaction).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Check whether a registration already exists

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Verify there is no valid registration UTxO already associated with this Cardano wallet. If one exists with a different DUST address, handle update/deregister first (outside this tutorial).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Submit the redemption + mapping transaction

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that (i) deposits the claimed cNIGHT into the redemption contract and (ii) creates a mapping UTxO at the mapping validator with a datum <code>CardanoAddress â†’ DUSTAddress</code> (inline datum per CIP-0032 acceptable).</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit the transaction; keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the mapping UTxO on Cardano and relays the mapping.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates its internal list of registered wallets and validity.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm DUST is producing

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>After relay, DUST production begins for the claimed cNIGHT from this redemption.</Step>
  <Step>Any future cNIGHT UTxOs received by the same Cardano wallet will also produce DUST to the mapped Midnight address.</Step>
