# Update DUST Address

Change the mapped Midnight DUST address for a registered Cardano wallet so that future cNIGHT UTxOs generate DUST to a new destination.

## Prerequisites

- You are already registered (Cardano wallet to DUST address mapping exists and was relayed)
- Control of the Cardano wallet that signed the original registration
- The new Midnight DUST address you want to map
- (Recommended) The current registration UTxO reference at the mapping validator

## Steps

### Prepare inputs

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Collect your Cardano wallet address and the new Midnight DUST address.</Step>
  <Step>Locate the existing registration UTxO at the mapping validator (to be spent as part of the update).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Build the update transaction (deregister + new register)

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Construct a Cardano transaction that spends the current registration UTxO (effectively a deregistration) and creates a new registration UTxO at the mapping validator.</Step>
  <Step>Attach a datum to the new registration UTxO encoding <code>CardanoAddress → NewDUSTAddress</code> (inline datum per CIP-0032 acceptable).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Sign and submit

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Sign the transaction with the appropriate Cardano key(s) and submit it to the network.</Step>
  <Step>Record the resulting <code>txHash</code> for audit and troubleshooting.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the spent (old) and created (new) registration UTxOs on Cardano and relays the updated mapping.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates its internal state and history to reflect the new DUST address mapping.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm the update

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the node’s public status to confirm the wallet is registered with the new DUST address.</Step>
  <Step>From now on, any new cNIGHT UTxOs received by this wallet will produce DUST to the new address.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
