# Check registration and UTxO status

Verify whether your Cardano wallet is registered for DUST, whether the mapped DUST address is valid, and which of your **NIGHT UTxOs (on Cardano)** are producing vs. not producing DUST.

## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet address to inspect  
- Access to a status view or tool that queries:
  - the node’s public API (registration state and mapped DUST address validity)
  - the observability/indexer (your NIGHT UTxOs on Cardano with creation/spent info)

## Status values to handle

- **unregistered** — no valid registration UTxO is recognized for this wallet.  
- **pending** — a registration was submitted but is still within ingestion/relay windows (not yet effective).  
- **registered** — a single valid mapping is active and recognized; DUST address is valid.  
- **invalid** — a mapping exists but is not recognized as valid by the node (e.g., malformed or superseded).

> **Registration time** is the moment the **registration UTxO is first observed and accepted** (ingested and recognized) by the node. Producing vs. non-producing classification keys off this time.

## Steps

### Provide the wallet address to check
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Select or enter the Cardano wallet address whose status you want to inspect.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Retrieve registration state and DUST address validity
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the node public API for this wallet’s registration state (<em>unregistered</em>, <em>pending</em>, <em>registered</em>, or <em>invalid</em>).</Step>
  <Step>Confirm whether a mapped DUST address exists and is recognized as valid by the node.</Step>
  <Step>If <em>unregistered</em> or <em>invalid</em>, no UTxOs are considered generating until a valid registration is created and relayed.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### List UTxOs and classify generating vs. non-generating
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>From the observability/indexer, obtain the wallet’s <strong>NIGHT UTxOs (on Cardano)</strong> with creation time and spent status.</Step>
  <Step>Determine the <strong>registration time</strong> (when the registration UTxO was observed/accepted by the node).</Step>
  <Step><strong>Generating UTxOs</strong>: NIGHT UTxOs created <em>at or after</em> the registration time that remain unspent.</Step>
  <Step><strong>Non-generating UTxOs</strong>: NIGHT UTxOs created <em>before</em> the registration time; activate by re-spending to your own wallet to create fresh outputs. It is possible to generate Dust for a different address if there was a different registration prior.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm results
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Summarize: registration state, DUST address validity, and counts/lists of <strong>Generating</strong> vs. <strong>Non-producing</strong> UTxOs.</Step>
  <Step>Status may show as <em>pending</em> during ingestion/relay windows; refresh after indexing completes.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
