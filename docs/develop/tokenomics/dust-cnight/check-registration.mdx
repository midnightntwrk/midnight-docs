# Check registration and UTxO status

Verify whether your Cardano wallet is registered for DUST, whether the mapped DUST address is valid, and which of your cNIGHT UTxOs are producing vs. not producing DUST.

## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet address to inspect  
- Access to a status view or tool that queries:
  - the node’s public API (registration state and mapped DUST address validity)
  - the observability/indexer (your cNIGHT UTxOs with creation/spent info)

## Steps

### Provide the wallet address to check
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Select or enter the Cardano wallet address whose status you want to inspect.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Retrieve registration state and DUST address validity
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the node public API for this wallet’s registration state.</Step>
  <Step>Confirm whether a mapped DUST address exists and is recognized as valid by the node.</Step>
  <Step>If not registered, no UTxOs are considered producing until registration is created and relayed.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### List UTxOs and classify producing vs. non-producing
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>From the observability/indexer, obtain the wallet’s cNIGHT UTxOs (with creation time and spent status).</Step>
  <Step>Determine the registration time (the time the registration UTxO was observed/accepted).</Step>
  <Step>Producing UTxOs are cNIGHT UTxOs created at or after the registration time that remain unspent.</Step>
  <Step>Non-producing UTxOs are cNIGHT UTxOs created before registration; activate them by re-spending to your own wallet.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm results
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Provide a summary showing whether the wallet is registered, whether the mapped DUST address is valid, and which cNIGHT UTxOs are producing versus non-producing (include counts and lists).</Step>
  <Step>Status may show as pending while data is being ingested and relayed; refresh after indexing finishes.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
