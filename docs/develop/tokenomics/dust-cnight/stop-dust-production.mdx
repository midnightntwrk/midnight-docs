# Stop DUST production from specific UTxOs

After deregistration previously producing cNIGHT UTxOs can continue to produce until they’re spent. Use this procedure to terminate their DUST lifecycle.

## Prerequisites

- The wallet has been deregistered (no active registration UTxO)
- Access to tooling (DApp or CLI/SDK) that can:
  - list producing UTxOs post-deregistration
  - build and submit a Cardano transaction spending selected UTxOs

## Steps

### Identify producing UTxOs post-deregistration
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query the observability/indexer for your wallet’s cNIGHT UTxOs and filter those still marked producing after deregistration.</Step>
  <Step>Record the UTxO references you intend to deactivate.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Spend the selected UTxOs to terminate production
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that spends the selected producing UTxOs (e.g., return the tokens to your own address or consolidate into a new output).</Step>
  <Step>Ensure required ADA is included for multi-asset outputs. Preserve token balances as desired.</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit the transaction; keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and ledger update
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the spent UTxOs and the newly created outputs (if any).</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates ledger state so production for the spent UTxOs is ended.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm production has stopped
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Re-query status: the previously producing UTxOs should appear as spent and no longer producing.</Step>
  <Step>Any new UTxOs created by this spend (under a deregistered wallet) are non-producing.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
