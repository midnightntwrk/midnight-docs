# Deregister wallet

Stop **new NIGHT UTxOs (on Cardano)** from generating DUST by removing the wallet’s active registration.

* **Effect overview:** After deregistration, **new** NIGHT UTxOs will **not** generate DUST.  
* Any **already-generating** UTxOs continue generating **until they are spent**.  

## Prerequisites

- You are currently registered (there is a registration UTxO at the mapping validator)
- Control of the Cardano wallet that created the registration
- (Recommended) The current registration UTxO reference

## Steps

### Identify the current registration UTxO
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Locate the wallet’s registration UTxO at the mapping validator (the one that encodes <code>CardanoAddress → DUSTAddress</code>).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Spend the registration (deregistration transaction)
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that spends the registration UTxO (no new mapping UTxO is created).</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit the transaction; keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the spent registration and relays the change.</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node updates its internal registration state for this wallet.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm deregistration is effective
<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query status to confirm the wallet is <strong>not registered</strong>.</Step>
  <Step>From this point, any <strong>new</strong> NIGHT UTxOs received by this wallet will <strong>not</strong> generate DUST. Existing generating UTxOs will continue until spent (see <a href="./stop-dust-generation">Stop DUST generation from specific UTxOs</a>).</Step>
</StepsProvider>
