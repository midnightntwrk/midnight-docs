# Produce DUST from previously owned tokens

Retroactively enable DUST production for **older cNIGHT UTxOs** by re-spending them to yourself to create fresh, producing UTxOs under your existing registration.

## Prerequisites

- You are already registered (Cardano wallet to Midnight DUST address mapping is active and relayed)
- Cardano wallet holding older, non-producing cNIGHT UTxOs
- Access to a status/tooling view (DApp or CLI/SDK) that can:
  - list your cNIGHT UTxOs with creation time
  - build and submit a Cardano transaction spending selected UTxOs back to your own wallet

## Steps

### List non-producing UTxOs

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Query your wallet’s cNIGHT UTxOs (with creation timestamp) from the observability/indexer.</Step>
  <Step>Determine the registration time for your wallet.</Step>
  <Step>Classify as non-producing any cNIGHT UTxOs created before registration (or otherwise flagged non-producing).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Select UTxOs to activate

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Choose one or more non-producing cNIGHT UTxOs to activate via respend.</Step>
  <Step>Optionally, keep some older UTxOs untouched if you don’t want to activate them yet.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Respend to self (on Cardano)

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Build a Cardano transaction that spends the selected UTxOs and returns the cNIGHT back to your own wallet (self-transfer), creating new UTxOs.</Step>
  <Step>Preserve the token amounts; include required ADA for multi-asset UTxOs as needed by Cardano.</Step>
  <Step>Sign and submit the transaction; keep the resulting <code>txHash</code>.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Allow indexing and relay to Midnight

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>The observability layer detects the newly created cNIGHT UTxOs (now post-registration).</Step>
  <Step>The Midnight node ingests this state; those fresh UTxOs are considered eligible to produce DUST.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

### Confirm DUST is producing

<StepsProvider>
  <Step>Re-query status: the newly created (self-spent) UTxOs now appear as producing; the old UTxOs appear spent.</Step>
  <Step>Monitor DUST accrual to your mapped Midnight DUST address according to protocol parameters.</Step>
</StepsProvider>
