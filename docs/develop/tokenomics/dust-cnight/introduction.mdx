# Generate DUST from cNIGHT

This section walks you through the process of using **cNIGHT** holdings to generate **DUST**, the resource token that powers private and predictable execution on Midnight.  

Where the [Tokenomics overview](../introduction) explains the economic model, this part is all about hands-on usage. Each tutorial focuses on one step of the process, from connecting your Cardano wallet to managing registrations, resyncing after chain events, and handling advanced cases.


## Why this matters

Holding NIGHT is only the starting point. To actually produce DUST, you must opt in and map your NIGHT holdings to a Midnight DUST address. This process is unique to Midnight: it preserves privacy, prevents hoarding through decay, and gives users direct control over where their DUST is directed.  

The tutorials in this section will make this process transparent and approachable, both for end users and for developers who need to integrate the flow into wallets or backends.
