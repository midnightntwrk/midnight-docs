# Economic governance

This page outlines the **levers** and responsibilities that govern DUST economics.

## Scope of governance

- **DUST parameters:** generation rates, decay parameters, optional caps.
- **Upgrade paths:** how parameter changes are proposed, approved, and activated.
- **Transparency:** how changes are surfaced in node telemetry and public APIs.

## Principles

- **Predictability:** Changes respect notice periods or activation windows.
- **Observability:** Nodes expose current effective parameters and activation heights/slots.
- **Safety:** Guardrails limit extreme updates.

## Change lifecycle (conceptual)

1. **Proposal** drafted with parameter diffs and rationale.
2. **Approval** through the configured governance mechanism.
3. **Activation** at an announced slot/epoch; nodes apply new parameters.
4. **Publication** in node API and release notes for downstream clients.

## Developer impact

- Wallets and DApps should **query** the node API for *current parameters* rather than hardcoding.
- Cost estimators should adapt automatically as parameters change.
