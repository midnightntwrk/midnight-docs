# Token types on Midnight

Understand the categories of tokens on Midnight, how they move, and what developers can (and can’t) see.

## Categories

- **Native ledger tokens:** `NIGHT`, `DUST`  
  - `NIGHT` is transferable.  
  - `DUST` is **non-transferable** and is **consumed** to execute transactions (see [Building DApps with DUST](/develop/tokenomics/dapps-with-dust) and [Generation & Decay](/develop/tokenomics/generation-and-decay)).

- **Native contract tokens (shielded):**  
  Issued and managed by a smart contract; state is shielded and access is through contract views/proofs. See [Developer considerations](/develop/tokenomics/developer-considerations).

- **Custom ledger tokens (unshielded):**  
  User-minted tokens that live directly on the ledger UTxO model (public balances/flows). See **Unshielded token API** (link when available).

- **Custom contract tokens (shielded):**  
  User-minted tokens managed by contracts with private state. See **Shielded token API** (link when available) and [Developer considerations](/develop/tokenomics/developer-considerations).

## Comparison (at a glance)

| Class                               | Transferable | Privacy model         | Mint/Burn authority                  | How fees are paid | Typical use cases                              |
|-------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **NIGHT (native ledger)**           | Yes          | Public UTxO metadata  | Protocol / governed policies         | **DUST**          | Payments, staking rewards, governance          |
| **DUST (native ledger)**            | **No**       | Public amount; non-xfer | Protocol (generation/decay governed) | N/A (is the fee)  | Execution resource (consumed by txs)          |
| **Custom ledger (unshielded)**      | Yes          | Public UTxO metadata  | Token policy holder(s)               | **DUST**          | Fungible/non-fungible assets with public flows |
| **Native contract (shielded)**      | Contract-defined | **Private state** behind views/proofs | Contract logic + governance           | **DUST**          | Private payments, private app-level assets     |
| **Custom contract (shielded)**      | Contract-defined | **Private state** behind views/proofs | Contract logic + token policy, if any| **DUST**          | dApp-defined tokens with privacy semantics     |

:::note
“Transferable” for shielded classes means “movable via the contract’s rules.” Visibility of amounts/holders is contract-controlled, not globally public.

## Metadata & visibility

- **Ledger tokens (NIGHT, DUST, custom unshielded):**  
  Amounts, policy IDs, and movements are visible in UTxOs (subject to address privacy choices). Indexers and wallets can compute balances directly.

- **Shielded tokens (native or custom):**  
  Balances and movements are **not** globally visible. UIs must use **contract views** and/or **user-provided proofs**. Show minimal facts (e.g., “sufficient to proceed”) instead of exact numbers unless the user consents to disclose.


## Glossary

- **Policy ID:** The identifier that governs mint/burn rules for an unshielded (ledger) token.  
- **Shielded contract token:** A token whose balances and transfers are maintained by a smart contract with private state, exposed through controlled views/proofs.  
- **UTxO (Unspent Transaction Output):** Ledger record representing spendable value at an address.
