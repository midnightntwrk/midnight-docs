# Token types on Midnight

## Categories

- **Native ledger tokens:** `NIGHT`, `DUST`
  - NIGHT is transferable; DUST is non-transferable and consumed for execution.
- **Native contract tokens (shielded):**
  - Issued by contracts with privacy semantics (shielded state/notes).
- **Custom ledger tokens (unshielded):**
  - User-minted CNAs with public UTxO semantics.
- **Custom contract tokens (shielded):**
  - User-minted and managed by contracts with shielded state.

## Metadata & visibility

- Ledger tokens: visible at UTxO level (subject to privacy of holders).
- Shielded tokens: visibility gated by proof/viewing rules of their contracts.

## Parallels

- Rough parallels to ERC-20 / CIP-68 exist for fungible issuance and metadata, but semantics differ for shielded assets and DUST non-transferability.
