# Developer considerations

## Issuance & interaction

- **Ledger tokens:** Mint/burn via ledger rules; track in UTxOs.
- **Contract tokens (shielded):** Issue via contract entrypoints; interact using proofs.

## Querying balances

- Use SDK / RPC to query:
  - Ledger balances (unshielded)
  - Contract-exposed views (shielded) per contract policy

## Privacy & interoperability

- Respect contract-level privacy constraints for shielded tokens.
- Provide fallback UX for users with NIGHT but insufficient DUST (e.g., prompts to generate or acquire DUST through designated flows).
