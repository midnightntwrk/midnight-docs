# DUST generation & decay

This page defines the conceptual mechanics for how DUST supply is created and removed. Parameters are governed and may change over time. Tutorials reference this page to explain expected behaviors without assuming specific values.

## Concepts

- **Designation:** NIGHT holdings that are eligible to generate DUST (per protocol rules).
- **Generation:** DUST accrues continuously from designated NIGHT, up to any effective cap that may apply.
- **Decay:** DUST adjusts toward the governed target (e.g., via decay) so balances don’t grow without bound and remain predictable under changing conditions.
- **Consumption:** Executing transactions **spends** (burns) DUST.
- **Caps / Safeguards:** A per-NIGHT cap may bound effective generation to reduce outlier effects.

## High-level behavior

- Let `G(t)` denote the generation rate at time `t`, governed.
- Let `D(t)` denote adjustment/decay dynamics over time `t`, governed (e.g., exponential or piecewise-linear).
- **Effective DUST** at time `t2` from designated NIGHT amount `N` starting at `t1` is:

```
DUST(t2) = ∫[t1→t2] ( N × G(t) ) dt − ∫[t1→t2] ( Adjustment/Decay(DUST, t) ) dt − Consumption
```

:::note
The exact functional form, units, and any cap semantics are protocol-defined and may be updated by governance.

## Non-transferability (rationale)

- DUST is not transferable. This prevents fee markets from leaking metadata through price signals and aligns cost predictability with protocol-governed parameters rather than market volatility.

## Example scenarios (non-normative)

- **Steady state (top-up to cap):** With stable `G` and the governed adjustment/decay in effect, balances top up toward the effective cap for the user’s designated NIGHT. Routine spending draws DUST down and it re-accrues toward the cap.
- **Burst usage:** A spike in consumption temporarily drops the balance below its steady level; ongoing generation replenishes it toward the effective cap.
- **Change in NIGHT (increase):** When designated NIGHT increases, the target rises; generation pushes the balance upward toward the new effective cap.
- **Change in NIGHT (decrease/transfer out):** When designated NIGHT decreases, the target falls; subsequent adjustment/decay and/or spending bring the balance down toward the lower target.

## Governance parameters

- Generation rate schedule `G(t)`
- Adjustment/decay function parameters
- Optional per-NIGHT cap (if enabled)
- Accounting intervals and rounding behavior for node APIs

## Developer notes

- Treat all values as governed and dynamic. Do not hardcode rates, caps, or decay.  
- Always query live parameters (e.g., via node/indexer APIs) and be activation-aware (slot/epoch-gated updates).  
- Estimators should recompute using the current effective parameters and handle changes in designated NIGHT by re-evaluating the user’s target/cap and expected replenishment behavior.
