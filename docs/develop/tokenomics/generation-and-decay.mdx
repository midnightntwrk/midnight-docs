# DUST generation and decay

This page defines the conceptual mechanics for how DUST supply is created and removed. Parameters are governed and may change over time. Tutorials reference this page to explain expected behaviors without assuming specific values.

## Concepts

- **Designation:** NIGHT holdings that are eligible to generate DUST (per protocol rules).
- **Generation:** DUST accrues continuously from designated NIGHT, up to any effective cap that may apply. The generation function is linear. The linear parameter is governed.
- **Decay:** DUST adjusts toward the target (e.g., via decay) so balances don’t grow without bound and remain predictable under changing conditions. The decay function is linear. The linear parameter is governed.
- **Consumption:** Executing transactions **spends** (burns) DUST.

## High-level behavior

- Dust evolves linearly over time based on its backing Night UTXO.
- While the Night UTXO remains unspent, Dust accumulates at a fixed rate up to a defined maximum.
- Once the Night UTXO is spent, Dust decays back toward zero at the same rate.

Formally, for a Night amount N created at time t₁ and evaluated at time t₂:

```
v_full = N × night_dust_ratio
rate   = N × generation_decay_rate

if t₂ ≤ dtime:          # Generation phase
    DUST(t₂) = min(v_full, rate × (t₂ - t₁))

else:                   # Decay phase
    DUST(t₂) = max(0, v_full - rate × (t₂ - dtime))
```

The parameters `night_dust_ratio`, `generation_decay_rate`, and the grace period governing time windows are protocol-defined and may be updated through governance.

## Non-transferability (rationale)

- DUST is not transferable. This prevents fee markets from leaking metadata through price signals and aligns cost predictability with protocol-governed parameters rather than market volatility.

## Example scenarios (non-normative)

- **Steady state (top-up to cap):** With stable `G` and the governed adjustment/decay in effect, balances top up toward the effective cap for the user’s designated NIGHT. Routine spending draws DUST down and it re-accrues toward the cap.
- **Burst usage:** A spike in consumption temporarily drops the balance below its steady level; ongoing generation replenishes it toward the effective cap.
- **Change in NIGHT (increase):** When designated NIGHT increases, the target rises; generation pushes the balance upward toward the new effective cap.
- **Change in NIGHT (decrease/transfer out):** When designated NIGHT decreases, the target falls; subsequent adjustment/decay and/or spending bring the balance down toward the lower target.

## Governance parameters

Dust behavior is defined by three protocol parameters:

- `night_dust_ratio` – Max Dust per Night (`v_full = N × night_dust_ratio`).
- `generation_decay_rate` – Linear rate for both DUST generation and decay.
- `dust_grace_period` – Allowed delay between transaction creation and block inclusion.

Units:

- 1 NIGHT = `10⁶` Stars
- 1 DUST = `10¹⁵` Specks

Initial values:

```
night_dust_ratio      = 5_000_000_000; // 5 DUST per NIGHT
generation_decay_rate = 8_267;         // ≈ 1 week to reach cap
dust_grace_period     = 3 hours;
```

:::note
These parameters are protocol-defined and adjustable by governance.

## Developer notes

- Treat all values as governed and dynamic. Do not hardcode rates, caps, or decay.  
- Always query live parameters (e.g., via node/indexer APIs) and be activation-aware (slot/epoch-gated updates).  
- Estimators should recompute using the current effective parameters and handle changes in designated NIGHT by re-evaluating the user’s target/cap and expected replenishment behavior.
