# DUST generation & decay

This page defines the conceptual mechanics for how DUST supply is created and removed. Parameters are governed and may change over time. Tutorials reference this page to explain expected behaviors without assuming specific values.

## Concepts

- **Designation:** NIGHT holdings that are eligible to generate DUST (per protocol rules).
- **Generation:** DUST accrues as a function of designated NIGHT and governed rates.
- **Decay:** DUST balances **decrease continuously** by a governed decay function to prevent hoarding and stabilize fee markets.
- **Consumption:** Executing transactions **spends** (burns) DUST.
- **Caps / Safeguards:** A per-NIGHT cap may bound effective generation to reduce outlier effects.

## High-level behavior

- Let `G(t)` denote the **generation rate** at time `t`, governed.
- Let `D(t)` denote **decay** over time `t`, governed (e.g., exponential or piecewise-linear).
- **Effective DUST** at time `t2` from designated NIGHT amount `N` starting at `t1` is:

```
DUST(t2) = ∫[t1→t2] ( N × G(t) ) dt - ∫[t1→t2] ( Decay(DUST, t) ) dt - Consumption
```


> The exact functional form and units are protocol-defined and may be updated by governance.

## Non-transferability (rationale)

- DUST is not transferable. This prevents fee markets from leaking metadata through price signals and aligns cost predictability with protocol-governed parameters rather than market volatility.

## Example scenarios (non-normative)

- **Steady state:** With stable `G` and decay, balances converge; users maintain enough DUST by simply holding NIGHT.
- **Burst usage:** A spike in consumption reduces DUST; balances rebuild automatically via generation.
- **Decay pressure:** Idle DUST decays, discouraging hoarding and keeping fee pressure predictable.

## Governance parameters

- Generation rate schedule `G(t)`
- Decay function parameters
- Optional per-NIGHT cap (if enabled)
- Accounting intervals and rounding behavior for node APIs
