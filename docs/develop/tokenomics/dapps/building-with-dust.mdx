# Building DApps with DUST

Guidance for using DUST as the execution resource in DApps.

## Paying fees in DUST

- Transactions consume DUST; ensure the sender has sufficient DUST according to current parameters.

## Estimating cost

- Retrieve current generation/decay parameters.
- Use node-provided estimators where available; avoid hardcoded constants.

## Wallet connection & checks

- On submit:
  - Check registration state and mapped DUST address (if relevant).
  - Verify DUST sufficiency; provide remediation path (e.g., register or wait for generation).

## Errors & recovery

- Handle “insufficient DUST” distinctly from general submission errors.
- Provide deterministic retries after parameter/query refresh.

## Testing

- Use local/test environments with predictable parameters.
- Validate behavior around boundary conditions (near-zero DUST, decay windows).
