# Protocol-level token bridge

This page describes the canonical one-way bridge from Cardano to Midnight for NIGHT.

## High-level sequence

1. **Lock on Cardano:** NIGHT (or test variants) are locked under a bridge policy.
2. **Observe & attest:** Partner-Chains/observability components detect finalized state.
3. **Mint on Midnight:** Corresponding mNIGHT is minted on Midnight.
4. **Finality window:** A time window (e.g., hours) ensures safe reconciliation.
5. **Status relay:** Bridge status is surfaced for builders and users.

## DUST context

- DUST is produced and consumed only on Midnight.
- Bridging does not transfer DUST.

## Mapping validator & status

- Mapping/attestation artifacts are observed to drive minting.
- Status should be exposed via public APIs for wallets/DApps to display progress.

## Governance/upgrade considerations

- Upgrade paths for rules, finality windows, or attestation logic.
- Backward-compatible status fields to avoid breaking integrators.
