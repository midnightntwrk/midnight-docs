# Protocol-level token bridge

This page describes the canonical one-way bridge from Cardano to Midnight for NIGHT.

## High-level sequence

1. **Lock on Cardano:** NIGHT (or test variants) are locked under a bridge policy.
2. **Observe & attest:** Partner-Chains/observability components detect finalized state and produce attestations.
3. **Mint on Midnight:** Corresponding **NIGHT on the Network** is minted on Midnight.
4. **Finality window:** A fixed reconciliation window (e.g., **~12 hours**, subject to governance/configuration) must elapse before the state is considered final.
5. **Status relay:** Bridge status is surfaced for builders and users via public APIs.

> Until the finality window closes, show **“Finality window in progress”** and treat state as pending.

## DUST context

- DUST is generated and consumed only on Midnight.
- Bridging does not transfer DUST (only NIGHT → NIGHT on the Network).

## Mapping validator & status

- Mapping/attestation artifacts on Cardano drive minting on Midnight.
- Status SHOULD be exposed via public APIs so wallets/DApps can display **Locked → Observed → Attested → Minted → Final**.

## Governance / upgrade considerations

- Upgrade paths for bridge rules, finality-window duration, or attestation logic.
- Backward-compatible status fields to avoid breaking integrators.
