# Bridge builder integration

Guidance for third-party builders integrating with the protocol bridge.

## Interfaces & events

- Observe Cardano lock transactions relevant to the bridge.
- Track attestation / mapping artifacts.
- Subscribe to Midnight mint events for mNIGHT.

## Patterns

- **Wrapped-asset UX:** show pending/finalized states, reorg tolerance.
- **Reconciliation:** periodic scans to reconcile off-chain view with canonical status.

## Best practices

- Avoid inferring finality from a single signal; respect the finality window.
- Expose user-visible status that matches protocol phases.

## Security considerations

- Validate policy IDs and mapping rules.
- Strictly parse attestations; treat unknown fields as non-authoritative.
