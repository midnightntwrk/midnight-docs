# Getting help

As a participant in the Midnight Testnet, you have the
opportunity to shape the future of Midnight by reporting issues,
suggesting enhancements, and directly influencing the development
process.

## Connectivity failures, bugs, general problems, and suggestions

There are two ways to report problems, make suggestions, give
feedback, or just ask for help:

1. Participate in a discussion on the [Midnight Discord server](https://discord.gg/midnightnetwork). The
   Midnight team will be monitoring the
   `#support` channel
   regularly.
   **Important:** when you first join the Midnight Discord server, you
   must accept the rules in the
   `#rules`
   before you can access other content on the server.
2. Send email to [Midnight support](mailto:support@midnight.network).

## Security vulnerabilities

If you discover any security vulnerabilities in the Midnight libraries
or infrastructure, please report them using the following protocol:

1. Do _not_ post security vulnerabilities on the support channel on
   Discord.
2. Instead, please send a report of what you have found to the
   Midnight support email address: [support@midnight.network](mailto:support@midnight.network).
   If you have a fix or workaround for the vulnerability, please describe that, too.
3. The Midnight team will evaluate your report and may release a fix
   or publish instructions for mitigating the vulnerability. The team
   will inform you of the outcome directly.
4. Unless you request otherwise, the Midnight team will credit you for
   finding the problem in any publication of a fix or mitigation.
5. After the Midnight team has either published a fix or informed you
   that the vulnerability will not be addressed, you are free to
   disclose it publicly.
