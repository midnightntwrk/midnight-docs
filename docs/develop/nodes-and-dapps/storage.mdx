# Storage

Midnight is built using the Polkadot SDK (formerly Substrate), and uses ParityDB as its default database backend.

* **ParityDB**: A fast key-value store designed for blockchain use cases, storing all on-chain state.
* **Merkle-Patricia Trie**: Used as the underlying data structure for state commitments. This structure ensures state integrity and efficient proofs of inclusion for any on-chain data (e.g., contract state or account balances).
* **twoxhash**: A non-cryptographic hash function used to generate storage keys within the trie. It is optimized for speed and low collision rates, making it ideal for internal key-value lookups. While not suitable for cryptographic guarantees, it significantly improves trie performance.

All state transitions are committed into this trie and persisted via ParityDB.
