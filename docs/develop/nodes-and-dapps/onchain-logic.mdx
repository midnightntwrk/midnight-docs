# Onchain Logic and State

The Midnight node follows the standard Polkadot SDK model for defining and executing on-chain logic. All core logic (except native pre-compiles) is compiled into **WebAssembly (WASM)**, which forms the node’s **runtime**—the state transition function executed consistently across all participating nodes.

This runtime is composed of modular components known as **FRAME pallets**. Each pallet encapsulates a specific domain of logic and can include storage definitions (maps, multi-key maps, lists, values), events, dispatchable functions (transactions), offchain workers, hooks, host-exposed functions, and RPC methods. This modular design allows for a flexible and extensible on-chain execution environment, similar in spirit to a smart contract framework but compiled ahead of time and governed at the chain level.

Midnight’s runtime integrates both upstream pallets from **Polkadot SDK** and components developed by **Cardano Partner-Chains**. Examples include:

- `pallet-aura`: Handles block production using the AURA protocol.
- `pallet-grandpa`: Manages finality through the GRANDPA protocol.
- `pallet-partnerchains-session` and `pallet_session_validator_management`: Coordinate session rotation and validator management in the partnerchain context.

The **core pallet** powering Midnight’s privacy-preserving transaction logic is `pallet-midnight`. Maintained internally, this pallet encapsulates the state machine for the **Midnight Ledger**.

The `pallet-midnight` is responsible for processing specialized transactions originating from the Midnight Ledger, including **ZSwap asset transfers** and **contract operations**. Rather than relying on traditional signature-based dispatch, this pallet processes cryptographic **proofs** embedded in each transaction. It leverages native libraries to verify these proofs and execute the corresponding state transitions.

Once executed, the new state is committed on-chain. Like all Polkadot SDK chains, Midnight uses a **Patricia-Merkle trie**, backed by a key-value database, to store the canonical ledger state. A **commitment to the full Midnight Ledger state** is also stored, ensuring a tamper-proof, verifiable snapshot of the system after each block.
