# Setting up Cardano-db-sync

As a [Partner Chain](https://github.com/input-output-hk/partner-chains), Midnight nodes need to track scripts on the Cardano blockchain. The Cardano-db-sync tool is used for this purpose; it follows the Cardano chain, extracting information from both the blockchain and an internally maintained ledger state. This data is then inserted into a PostgreSQL database. By providing a PostgreSQL interface, Cardano-db-sync enables Midnight nodes to follow and interact with the Cardano chain by allowing SQL queries to be executed directly against the database schema or through any language that has libraries for SQL database interactions.

Therefore, it is a requirement for Midnight nodes to have a persistant connection to a `Cardano-db-sync` instance.

## System Requirements

| **Requirement**      | **Cardano Mainnet**                                                                                      | **Preview Testnet**                                                  |

| **CPU Cores**        | 4 or more                                                                                                | 4 or more                                                            |
| **IOPS**             | 60,000 IOPS or better. Lower ratings will lead to slower sync times and/or falling behind the chain tip. | 30,000 IOPS or better. Lower ratings will lead to slower sync times. |
| **Disk Storage**     | 320 G, SSD                                                                                               | 40 G (preferably SSD)                                                |

## Installation

Installing Cardano-db-sync can be done via many methods such as, static binaries, Nix, building from source, and Docker. **This documentation will focus on the [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/) method.**

:::note

If at any point visit the official Cardano-db-sync repository for more information: https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync

:::

## Install Docker

- Install Docker Engine on Linux: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Verify Docker is installed

- Check Docker version and installation path:

```shell
docker --version # return docker version
which docker # returns executable path
```

- Verify Docker daemon is running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If Docker is running, the output may look like:

```shell
● docker.service - Docker Application Container Engine
   Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/docker.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-10-09 15:00:00 UTC; 1h 30min ago
```

## Clone `midnight-node-docker` Repository:

The [midnight-node-docker](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node-docker) repo contains a Docker Compose file to easily start up a Cardano-db-sync/ PostgreSQL instance on Preview Testnet.

- Clone the repo and change directory into it:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node-docker
cd midnight-node-docker
```

## Configure Cardano-db-sync/ PostgreSQL

Cardano-db-sync and PostgreSQL services are described in `compose-partner-chains.yml`.

:::important

Set a unique username, password and port for Cardano-db-sync and PostgreSQL for better security.

:::

- Open `compose-partner-chains.yml` in an editor, replace any default usernames, passwords, and ports with unique values that only you know.
- Comment out the `Ogmios` service (unless you are a block producer who needs it for block production operations).
- Save `compose-partner-chains.yml`.

## Start Cardano-db-sync/ PostgreSQL

- Start services described in `compose-partner-chains.yml`:

```shell
docker-compose -f compose-partner-chains.yml up -d
```

- Query Cardano-db-sync synchronization progress:

  - Using `psql` directly:
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-client # install psql client
    ```
    - Log into PostgreSQL shell using psql:
    ```shell
    psql -h localhost -U postgres -d cexplorer -p 5432
    ```
  - Optionally, log in to PostgreSQL shell using docker:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it db-sync-postgres psql -U postgres -d cexplorer
    ```
    Then, run the following query inside the PostgreSQL shell to check current synchronization status:
    ```shell
    SELECT 100 * (
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) -
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'))
    ) / (
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) -
        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'))
    ) AS sync_percent
    FROM block;
    ```
  - Using ssh remotely:

    If you want to query remotely, run this command via SSH:

    ```shell
    ssh user@x.x.x.x -C "psql -d cexplorer -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres -c \"SELECT 100 * (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'))) / (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC')) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MIN(time) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'))) AS sync_percent FROM block;\""
    ```

    Replace user@x.x.x.x with your SSH username and server IP address.

:::tip

Cardano-db-sync must fully sync for Midnight nodes to operate.
