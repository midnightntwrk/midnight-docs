# Consensus

The Midnight network leverages a modified consensus model built on top of standard **Substrate primitives**, specifically **AURA** for block production and **GRANDPA** for finality. These components have been extended to support the unique requirements of Midnight as a Cardano Partnerchain.

## Validator Selection

Unlike standard Substrate chains, Midnight uses a **custom validator set selection function**. This mechanism accounts for **stake delegation from Cardano SPOs**, allowing existing Cardano validators to participate in Midnight consensus. The model also supports optional inclusion of **permissioned validators**, offering flexibility for hybrid public/private network deployments.

## AURA: Block Production

**AURA (Authority Round)** is a **proof-of-authority (PoA)** algorithm used to determine which validator is responsible for producing each block. Validators take turns in a **round-robin fashion**, based on predefined slots and session keys. This model is simple, fast, and deterministic, making it suitable for high-throughput blockchains with known validator sets.

AURA is not specific to Midnight and was originally implemented in [OpenEthereum](https://github.com/paritytech/openethereum). You can read more in the [Polkadot protocol glossary](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/blob/79fe4ec5498411bc8ac8bfef58c79cd2c6713090/polkadot-protocol/glossary.md?plain=1#L29).


## GRANDPA: Finality

**GRANDPA (GHOST-based Recursive ANcestor Deriving Prefix Agreement)** is a finality gadget that provides **asynchronous, provable finality**. It operates independently of block production, allowing validators to vote on chains and finalize blocks that have received sufficient support.

GRANDPA is a general-purpose consensus component originally developed for Polkadot and is **not specific to Midnight**. You can find its [formal specification here](https://github.com/w3f/consensus/blob/master/pdf/grandpa.pdf) and learn more in the [Polkadot protocol glossary](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/polkadot-docs/blob/79fe4ec5498411bc8ac8bfef58c79cd2c6713090/polkadot-protocol/glossary.md?plain=1#L186).
