# Setting up Boot Nodes for Midnight

Boot nodes are a valuable part of the Midnight network, acting as initial connection points for nodes joining the network. While running a bootnode is optional for end users, doing so helps expand the list of available nodes.

## Boot Node

A **boot node** is a specialized type of node that helps other nodes connect to the Midnight blockchain by providing a list of active peer addresses. Rather than being defined by a unique configuration, any node used to share connection information qualifies as a boot node.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your Midnight boot node, ensure you have the following:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed and configured.
* [Cardano-db-sync instance set up](./cardano-db-sync) with accessible PostgreSQL port.
* Sufficient resources (CPU, memory, and storage).

## Setting Up a Boot Node

### Step 1: Configure PostgreSQL Database

Set up a PostgreSQL instance with the following parameters:

* **Host:** PostgreSQL server address.
* **Port:** Default 5432.
* *Username:** Database user.
* **Password:** Database password.
* **Database Name:** Name of the database (e.g., cexplorer).

### Step 2: Run the Docker Command for a Boot Node

Use the following Docker command to set up your boot node:

```bash
docker run \
  --name midnight-boot-node \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -p 30333:30333 \
  -v midnight-data:/node \
  -e MIDNIGHT_NODE_IMAGE="midnightnetwork/midnight-node:<VERSION>" \ 
  -e BASE_PATH="./node/chain/" \
  -e CFG_PRESET="testnet" \
  midnightnetwork/midnight-node:<VERSION> \
  --listen-addr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/30333 \
  --bootnodes \
  /dns/boot-node-01.testnet-02.midnight.network/tcp/30333/ws/p2p/12D3KooWMjUq13USCvQR9Y6yFzYNYgTQBLNAcmc8psAuPx2UUdnB \
  --no-private-ip
```

Replace `<VERSION>` with the required version of the node according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../relnotes/support-matrix).

## Verifying the Node

### Check Logs

Monitor the node's logs to ensure it syncs with the network:

```bash
docker logs -f <node-name>
```

### Test Connectivity

Ensure the node's P2P port (default: `30333`) is open and reachable for network communication. Use tools like `telnet`, `netcat`, or `nmap` to verify the port status and ensure the node is properly connected to the network.
