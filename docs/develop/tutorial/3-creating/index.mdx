# Part 3: creating a new DApp

In the third part of the Midnight developer tutorial, you will:

1. Write a contract that works with both public and private data
2. Fill in the missing parts of the DApp code, to create a complete and working DApp
3. Run a Midnight node that is *disconnected* from the Midnight Testnet, for testing purposes
4. Switch from a test configuration to a production configuration and
   use your new DApp on Testnet.

The example throughout part 3 is still simple, but more realistic in
its scope than the counter DApp of part 2.  Most importantly, it
relies on Midnight's ability to use private data in public contracts,
while shielding the private data by keeping it entirely local.

Finally, we discuss some additional steps that developers should take in a
serious deployment to ensure the longevity of their DApp.

# Prerequisites for part 3

There are no additional prerequisite components to be installed for
part 3 of the tutorial. Instead, you will learn to reconfigure the
'headless' wallet and local Midnight node, which you installed in part
2, so that they operate in a disconnected mode for offline testing.

This part assumes that you have already downloaded and unpacked the Midnight
examples archive and
[performed the configuration steps in part 2](../2-building/examples-repo.mdx).

You will be writing some of the code yourself this time, but you will
start with the incomplete material in the `bboard-tutorial` directory:

```shell
cd examples/bboard-tutorial
```
