# DApp updatability

Updating code in a decentralized environment is challenging, because producing
an update is typically a centralized process, and this can be employed
maliciously. It is however often necessary to have some path to changing
deployed contracts and DApps, and Midnight provides this through *Contract
Maintenance Authorities* (CMAs).

By default, as has been the case through this tutorial, a maintenance authority
is empty, meaning no user is able to perform an update to the corresponding
contract. At deploy-time, the deployer can instead nominate a set of public
keys, and specify a threshold for how many of these public keys need to come together to
sign an update, to allow updatability of this contract. This can be used to
decentralize the power to update to a group, which needs to agree and sign off
on updates jointly, or simply to have a single owner control a contract.

:::warning

While Midnight does not require a deployed contract to nominate a CMA, we
strongly advise DApp authors to be aware of the trade-offs involved before
making this decision.

:::

## Why should you care?

Even if your are familiar with updatability in other blockchain ecosystems,
there is an important difference for Midnight that may affect what you think is
right for your DApp. In most ecosystems, a deployed contract is guaranteed to
run as deployed indefinitely, and this lessens the need for updatability. In
Midnight, as contracts *are* in part zero-knowledge proofs, any breaking update
to our proof system – including security updates – may require contracts to
update to the new proof system. Put differently, old contracts *may be
disabled* after system upgrades in the future.

This is especially true prior to mainnet, during which time we will not provide
any support for prior versions of our proof system. At or before mainnet launch
we will refine this support policy. Put differently: We will, with notice,
remove support for old deployments of contracts from Midnight. Updatable
contracts will be able to migrate, but non-upgradable ones will not, by
definition. Refer to the [release compatibility matrix](../../../relnotes/comp-matrix) for the complete versions overview.


:::danger

Non-upgradable contracts should plan to allow users to withdraw their funds in
a timely manner (in less than a week) to prevent loss of user funds. Upgradable
contracts should make a commitment to upgrade timelines, or similarly provide a
path to withdraw funds in case the contract is not upgraded.

:::

At this time, Midnight's APIs are tooled only towards one-user authorities,
although the underlying system can cope with arbitrary party configurations.

## Capabilities of a maintenance authority

A contract maintenance authority (CMA) is able to perform various privileged actions
to change a contract after deployment. These make use of a 'verifier key
version', a combined version of proving system and the onchain runtime. A
contract can have multiple active verifier key versions at the same time, and
can have keys registered for each of them. This allows supporting transitions
between versions, and in the future may be used to provide long-term support
for some verifier key versions. A contract maintenance authority can perform
the following privileged actions:

- Change the CMA associated with this contract – this CMA then succeeds the
  current one; this can be used to relinquish control.
- Remove a verifier key (of a specific version) from the contract – this will
  reject future transactions that attempt to use this operation with this
  specific verifier key version. The key removed must exist.
- Add a new verifier key of a specific version – this adds new functionality to
  a contract, or re-exports existing functionality with a new verifier key
  version. A key may not already exist to insert it, it must first be removed.

:::info

Removing and re-adding a verifier key can be used to change the implementation
of a circuit, modifying its behaviour. Be aware that this is a very powerful
capability!

:::

Maintenance authorities can make changes by signing a sequence of the above
'single updates' into a combined 'maintenance update'. Currently, maintenance
updates take effect immediately, although this functionality may be refined
over time.

## How to operate a maintenance authority

Maintaining a maintenance authority introduces three new things for a DApp developer to manage:

1. They need to generate and store key pairs for the authority
2. They need to modify deployment to add the authority
3. They need to provide an interface for the authority to produce and sign updates

The initial contract authority of a contract being deployed can be specified by providing a value for 
[`signingKey`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/DeployContractOptions)
in
[`DeployContractOptions`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/DeployContractOptions).
The initial signing key can be sampled with
[`sampleSigningKey`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/compact-runtime/functions/sampleSigningKey).
Note that the same CMA can be used in multiple contracts by specifying the same
signing key for different deployments.

A deployed contract's circuits can be updated using the
[`DeployedContract`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/DeployedContract)
object's
[`circuitMaintenanceTx`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/FoundContract#circuitmaintenancetx)
property, which contains one 
[`CircuitMaintenanceTxInterface`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/CircuitMaintenanceTxInterface)
for each circuit defined on the contract. This allows inserting new verifier keys and removing existing verifier keys with
[`insertVerifierKey`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/CircuitMaintenanceTxInterface#insertverifierkey)
and
[`removeVerifierKey`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/CircuitMaintenanceTxInterface#removeverifierkey)
respectively.
Similarly, a deployed contract's maintenance authority can be updated using the
[`DeployedContract`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/DeployedContract)'s
[`contractMaintenanceTx`](/develop/reference/midnight-api/midnight-js/@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts/type-aliases/FoundContract#contractmaintenancetx)
property. For example, `deployedContract.foo.insertVerifierKey(key)`
inserts the verifier key `key` for the `foo` circuit in the deployed contract
`deployedContract`.
