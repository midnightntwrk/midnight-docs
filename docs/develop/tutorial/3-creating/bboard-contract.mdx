# Bulletin board contract

Just as with the counter DApp, there are separate subdirectories in
the [`example-bboard`](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard) repository for the contract and the user
interaction code.
Unlike the simple counter DApp, however, the bulletin board DApp
demonstrates an additional useful separation: between user interface
code and the underlying application logic that is independent of the
user interface.  Keeping the user interface separate from the
application logic allows you to create a command-line version of the
bulletin board in this part of the tutorial and a web-based version in
a later part.
- `contract` - contains the Compact source for the bulletin board
  contract, plus associated TypeScript
- `api` - contains TypeScript source that implements the core behavior
  of the DApp, such as posting messages and taking them down, and
  depends on the `contract` code
- `bboard-cli` - contains the command-line interface for the text-based
  DApp and depends on both the `contract` and `api` code.


:::tip

This page walks step by step through the design of the bulletin board
contract.  The finished contract appears at the end of the page.  Midnight
recommends viewing and editing the contract using the
[Visual Studio Code extension for Compact](/docs/develop/tutorial/2-building/index.mdx#optional-visual-studio-code-vscode-extension-for-compact),
where you get nice colors and auto-completion of names.

:::

To create a Midnight contract for the bulletin board scenario, we need
to identify:
- The components of the contract's public state
- The visible operations that can be performed on the contract
- The private data and operations, used by the visible operations in
  ways that are provably valid, but not shared publicly.

The public state of the contract and the transaction history of the
public operations appear on the ledger of the Midnight blockchain.
Anyone can verify them.  The private data never has to leave the
DApp user's computer.

## Public ledger state on the blockchain

The public ledger state of the bulletin board consists of four
values:
1. A state: vacant or occupied
2. A message
3. A counter to identify *which* specific post is current
4. A public token produced by the user who made the current post, but
   from which their private identity cannot be derived.

The third value is perhaps less obvious than the others; it
corresponds to the 'that message' constraint mentioned on the
previous page.  When its value is 15, it says, 'The current message
is the 15th post.'  If you have ever implemented any sort of software
lock, it will not surprise you that the correct behavior is to
increment this counter whenever the board becomes vacant (not when it
becomes occupied), because that is the point at which the bulletin board
no longer holds the (previous) numbered post.

The fourth value should be a non-reversible hash of the owner's
identity and the posting sequence number (the counter).  No one can
figure out who posted the message from the token, but the user who
created the post can reliably derive that token again to satisfy the
identity-verification obligation.

Here is the type of that ledger state, specified in Midnight's Compact
contract language:

import CodeFromGithub from '@site/src/components/CodeFromGithub';

  language="compact"
/>



Some notes about the types used in this ledger declaration:
- Notice that Compact includes support for declaring new types, such as the
  enumeration type that encodes the vacant or occupied state of the bulletin
  board.  With the `export` modifier added to the declaration, the Compact
  compiler will generate TypeScript representations for the enumeration type and
  its values.
- Ledger fields with Compact types (such as `STATE`, `Maybe`, and `Bytes`)
  represent a mutable cell in the ledger, whose value can be updated by
  circuits.
- The ledger's `Counter` type (automatically initialized to zero), can be
  incremented by circuits.
- The builtin Compact `Opaque` type describes values whose internal structure is
  irrelevant to the contract.
- The standard library's `Maybe` type describes values that may be absent.  Its
  values are created using the `some` or `none` constructors.
- The owner's identity tokens are 256-bit hashes, which occupy 32 bytes.
- The standard library `CompactStandardLibrary` contains `Maybe`, `some`,
  `none`, and `Counter`.  (`Opaque` and `Bytes` are builtin Compact types.)

The contract need not explicitly initialize the `owner` field when
the ledger is constructed, because its value is not meaningful yet.
Every ledger field that is not explicitly initialized in the constructor
is initialized to the default value of its type if the type has a default
value.

## Enforcing the contract: circuits

Remember, anyone who uses this bulletin board will be required to
abide by its rules, but *they* must do the work of proving they
satisfied the contract.  When they make changes to the bulletin board,
they submit proofs that they followed the rules, and observers
can quickly verify their proofs.  Such proofs, which observers
can verify without access to the data that enabled the proof
construction, are called *zero-knowledge* proofs, and they are
implemented using *mathematical circuits*.

These ideas are not at all new; some of the important papers about
zero-knowledge proofs were published in the 1980s.  The more recent
developments are advances in the way such proofs can be generated and
verified automatically, without human intervention, and the way they
can be combined with public blockchains.

One of *Midnight's unique contributions* to this space is to make the
definition of zero-knowledge-based smart contracts and their
supporting circuits *accessible to general programmers*.

Begin by writing the `post` operation as a Compact `circuit`
definition.  The main obligation to be satisfied in this part of the
contract is the bulletin board's first rule: posting can occur only
when the board is vacant.

<CodeFromGithub

A `circuit` definition is much like a function definition.  It can specify input
parameters and a return value.  The current state of the ledger is also
implicitly available in the circuit definition.  As with the `enum STATE` type,
an `export` modifier has been added to this definition, so that the `post`
circuit can be called from TypeScript.

To establish enforced contractual obligations, the definition uses the `assert`
statement, which checks that some Boolean expression is true.  If the expression
is false, the transaction is aborted, reporting the failure using the message
specified in the `assert` statement.  The `assert` above checks that the board
is vacant when someone tries to post a message (rule 1).

What is this generated 'public key' that the `post` circuit writes
into the ledger's `owner` field to identify the user posting the
message?  It is derived by hashing a string with the sequence number
of the post and the user's secret key, which is not sent over the
network.  The code above has used a call to a 'helper' circuit
`publicKey`, which is defined in the same contract.  Here is its
definition:

<CodeFromGithub
  url="https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard/blob/main/contract/src/bboard.compact#L58-L60"
  language="compact"
/>


Three notes about this  definition:
1. The `persistentHash` function is defined in Compact's standard
   library.
2. Typically, you would not export helper circuits like this one,
   because there would be no reason to call them from TypeScript.  In
   this case, `publicKey` is exported so that its value can be logged
   by the DApp, for debugging purposes.
3. While this circuit is named `publicKey`, its return value is *not*
   truly one side of a key pair from public key cryptography.
   Instead, zero-knowledge circuits can be understood as a kind of
   generalization of public key cryptography.  The result of this
   circuit serves the same role as a public key, though, so its
   naming is intended to evoke that sense.

## Accessing private state

So, how to retrieve secret key needed by the `post` circuit and passed
to `publicKey`?  The function `localSecretKey` cannot be another
circuit, because the values returned by circuits are publicly
verifiable, and the value returned by this function should never
appear in the ledger.

This kind of function is called a *witness*.  Witness functions
provide the API to the private state of a contract, as maintained by
individual DApps that use the contract.  The contract does not
describe the definition of the witness; it merely declares the
witness's existence.  The DApp must implement it.  Here is the
declaration in the contract:

<CodeFromGithub
  url="https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard/blob/main/contract/src/bboard.compact#L39"
  language="compact"
/>



The return values of witnesses are presumed to be private data.  The Compact
compiler tracks them through the program and prevents them from leaking by being
revealed in the public ledger state.  Specifically, in the `post` circuit, the
result of `localSecretKey()` is presumed to be private.  Because this value is
passed to `publicKey`, the result of `publicKey` is also presumed to be
private (or at least, based on private data).  The compiler would signal an
error if it were written into the public ledger state.  In this case however,
the hash of the owner's identity combined with the sequence counter will not
leak the owner's identity.  Wrapping the public key value in `disclose` tells
the Compact compiler that this disclosure is intended.

With all these tools at hand, you can write the `takeDown` circuit,
which enforces the rule that only the owner of the current post can
take it down.  Of course, it also makes no sense to take down a post
from a vacant board, so the circuit checks that first:

<CodeFromGithub
  url="https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard/blob/main/contract/src/bboard.compact#L48-L56"
  language="compact"
/>


This circuit returns the message that was taken down, to demonstrate
that public circuits can return values, too.

When a DApp submits a `takeDown` transaction to the Midnight network, it does
not include the private data that would allow other contract participants to
check the second `assert`.  Notice that the Compact compiler does not require
`publicKey` to be explicitly `disclose`d in this circuit.  The `takeDown`
transaction includes a verifiable proof that each `assert` has been checked.
The compiler generates all the material to make this possible 'behind the
scenes,' without the DApp programmer ever having to write code that appears to
generate and transmit proofs.

## Compiling the contract

That's everything.  Here is the complete contract.

<CodeFromGithub
  url="https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-bboard/blob/main/contract/src/bboard.compact"
  language="compact"
/>


In the `contract` subdirectory of `bboard-tutorial`, there is a build
script to run the Compact compiler as part of the build, but it is
instructive to run the compiler manually this time.

Compile the `bboard.compact` with the Compact compiler
like this (assuming that you have added the Compact compiler's
directory to your `PATH` following the instructions provided in
[Running Midnight Compact compiler](/docs/develop/tutorial/2-building/index.mdx#running-midnight-compact-compiler)
and that your current directory is the
`contract` directory when you run the command):

```shell
compact compile src/bboard.compact src/managed/bboard
```

You should see a message about the circuit complexity for each of the
public circuits (`post`, `takeDown`, and `publicKey`) when you run
the compiler.  If you see an error message, check your code for
mistakes.  If you need help, contact the Midnight Developer Relations
team or your fellow developers on Discord.

You can see the TypeScript API that the Compact compiler generated for
the contract in `src/managed/bboard/contract/index.d.cts`.  The DApp
will rely on this API to deploy the contract and call the circuits.
