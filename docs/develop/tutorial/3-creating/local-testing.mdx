# Midnight test environment

In the preceding parts of the tutorial, you ran DApps that were
already complete and tested. In this part, however, you have been
writing portions of the DApp yourself, and you probably want to try
out your work _before_ deploying the DApp to the Midnight network.

The Midnight team has already created a compose file for Docker that
runs a proof server, Midnight node, and Midnight Indexer locally,
configured so that they run disconnected from the Midnight network.
In effect, the Midnight node acts as if it is its own isolated
Midnight network. This allows you to test contracts and DApps
entirely on your own system, before deploying them to the real
network.

If you want to review the details, you can see the Docker compose
definition in this file:

```
bboard-tutorial/bboard-cli/standalone.yml
```

The important part is the environment variable `CFG_PRESET` set to
`dev` in `node` definition. That tells the node to run standalone
without connecting to any other nodes.

Before running this test configuration, you must stop any existing
proof server, indexer, and node. Then, if you want, you can start and
stop the test configuration to verify that it works. 

Do not leave the test configuration running in Docker for the next
steps, though, because you will test the bulletin board DApp by
launching it with a command that starts and stops the whole
`standalone.yml` configuration automatically as part of running the
DApp.

## Run the DApp in standalone mode

In the `bboard-tutorial/bboard-cli` directory, launch the DApp with:

```shell
yarn standalone
```

After verifying that the latest images of the proof server, indexer,
and Midnight node are pulled from the Midnight image server, the DApp
will launch the Docker configuration in `standalone.yml` and wait
for it to be ready.

Then, the DApp will start in standalone mode, not prompting to create
or restore a wallet, but instead, creating a new wallet with tDUST
that is valid only for such offline testing.

:::note Wallet SDK v4.0.0+ Behavior in Standalone Mode
In standalone mode, the DApp uses `@midnight-ntwrk/wallet@4.0.0` to create a disposable wallet. This SDK version introduces important changes:

- Wallets are **always created from a seed**.
- Wallet addresses are shown in **Bech32m format** by default. If you need compatibility with legacy tools, convert them using [`@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-address-format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@midnight-ntwrk/wallet-sdk-address-format).
- Wallet state is no longer sufficient for restoration â€” the **seed must be preserved** even in offline tests if you want reproducibility.
:::


When the wallet is ready, DApp asks whether it should join an existing
contract or deploy a new one. There is no existing contract to join,
so deploy one. Then, explore the possibilities with the DApp, posting
a message and examining the public and private state.

When you exit the DApp, the Docker containers should stop be and be
cleaned up automatically.

## Run the DApp connected to the Testnet

When you are ready to try out your DApp on the Midnight Testnet, be
sure you have not left it running and that your standalone Docker
configuration has exited. Then,
[start your proof server](../using/proof-server) again. When it is
ready, start the DApp with this command:

```shell
yarn testnet-remote
```

This time, you will need real tDUST, so either create a new wallet and
transfer some tDUST to it from your [Midnight Lace wallet](/docs/develop/tutorial/1-using/chrome-ext.mdx),
or look back
at the logs from your experiments with the counter DApp in part 2 to
find the seed for your headless wallet:

```
examples/counter/counter-cli/logs/testnet
```

Once the DApp has found some tDUST in your wallet, it will proceed and
allow you to deploy your bulletin board to Testnet.

## Summary

Have fun playing with the bulletin board DApp. If you are ambitious,
you could create a separate DApp to watch a bulletin board, showing
the messages that are posted and saying when they are taken down. The
code in the `displayLedgerState` function in `bboard-cli/src/index.ts`
will help you get started. You could also share the address of your
bulletin board contract with a friend and see each other's posted
messages.

Congratulations! You have created a working DApp around a non-trivial
Midnight contract, with real rules that are enforced automatically.
You have written parts of the DApp yourself, and you have learned to
test it offline.

At this point, with the help of the reference documentation, you know
enough to begin creating your own command-line contracts and DApps.
Later parts of this developer tutorial will show you how to add a web
UI for your DApps and connect them to the Midnight Lace wallet.
