# Midnight developer tutorial

The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the experience of
using and creating Midnight decentralized applications (DApps).

All the content on this site is specific to Midnight testnet.  Both the documentation and the Midnight
network itself are subject to change prior to any wider public
release.

:::important

Testnet is a sandboxed development environment, so there are NO guarantees that the environment will persist data.

:::
## Audience

This tutorial is about being a Midnight DApp *developer*, who creates
Midnight DApps.  Midnight DApp *users* will not need to know anything
about how to author smart contracts or how to write DApp software.

The tutorial assumes you want to test drive the Midnight developer
experience without reconfiguring your own computer as a Midnight
developer system.  Therefore, Midnight provides
directory-local configuration files and Docker images that should
minimize the changes to your system.  If you don't already have Docker
installed on your system, the tutorial will point you in the right
direction to get it.

Midnight contracts are described in their own domain-specific
language, but Midnight DApps are written in TypeScript (or
JavaScript).  This tutorial does not assume you are a TypeScript
programmer, but it does assume:

- You are willing to read some TypeScript code.
- You are familiar with using a text editor to edit code.
- You are comfortable interacting with your system in a terminal
  window, typing (and pasting in) commands at a shell prompt.

If those assumptions do not describe you, you might like to review the [learn](../../learn/introduction/what-is-midnight/) section
to explore the features and benefits Midnight provides without getting into the technical details of coding.
