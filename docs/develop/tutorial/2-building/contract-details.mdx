# In detail: the counter contract

The remainder of this part of the tutorial examines first the
Compact contract and then the TypeScript code for the counter DApp.

The contract behind the counter DApp can be found within the
Counter Dapp examples directory at:

```
example-counter/contract/
```

The counter contract itself is very simple. Here are the entire
contents of `counter.compact`:

import CodeFromGithub from '@site/src/components/CodeFromGithub';

<CodeFromGithub
  url="https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-counter/blob/main/contract/src/counter.compact"
  language="compact"
/>



To make sense of this Compact code, start in the middle, with the `ledger` field
declaration. It says that the public state of the contract, visible on the
Midnight blockchain, includes a field `round`. The Midnight ledger supports
`Counter` as one of its [state
types](../../reference/compact/lang-ref#ledger-state-types), and the field is
declared to be of that type.

In addition to declaring ledger fields, a contract can declare the functions
that provide the interface to its private state, each marked with the `witness`
keyword. The counter contract has no support for such hidden, off-chain state,
so no witnesses are mentioned.

This contract provides a single public operation (_circuit_) that its users can
call: `increment`. The `increment` operation simply increments the value of the
`round` counter by `1`.

There are two other lines of code in this contract, at the top of the file.  The
first line is a `pragma` that specifies a constraint on the Compact language
version.  If the Compact compiler does not support the language versions
specified, it will signal a compile-time error.  The second is the `import` that
makes Compact's standard library (`CompactStandardLibrary`) available in this
file.  The standard library includes the ledger type `Counter` and so it has to
be imported to make that type available.

More interesting contracts can declare enumerations and structured types to be
used in the ledger, multiple circuits (including unexported ones called only by
other circuits in the contract), and the functions that manipulate private,
off-chain state. You will learn much more about Midnight contracts in the next
major section of this tutorial: the bulletin board example.
