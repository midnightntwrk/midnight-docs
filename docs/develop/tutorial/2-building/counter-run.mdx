# Run the counter DApp

Now you are ready to run the counter DApp, deploying a new instance of
its contract to the Midnight Testnet and submitting transactions
to the network.

## A command-line wallet

Because this DApp has no web-based user interface and runs outside of
your web browser, it cannot access the Midnight Lace wallet that you
installed in part 1 of the tutorial. Instead, the DApp initializes
a Midnight wallet that shares its core libraries with Lace wallet, but
which can be invoked through library calls in command-line
applications. (Many programmers refer to the software without a graphical
user interface as 'headless', so you may find text elsewhere that
refers to this wallet as the 'headless wallet'.)

When you run the DApp, the first thing it will do is instantiate its
wallet, either by creating a completely fresh one or by rebuilding the
wallet from a previously generated seed.  On the first run, you must
create a fresh one and transfer some tDUST to it from your Midnight
Lace wallet.  The instructions below guide you through the process.

## Run the counter CLI

1. Be sure the proof server that you installed in part 1 of the
   tutorial is started.

2. In the `counter/counter-cli` folder, launch the DApp with:
   ```shell
   yarn testnet-remote
   ```
   This starts the DApp in a configuration that uses your local proof
   server, but connects to cloud-deployed instances of a Midnight node
   and a Midnight Indexer, just as in part 1 of this tutorial.

3. Choose to build a fresh wallet.  The DApp will display the wallet's
   address and a balance of 0 tokens.

   The seed for the freshly created wallet will also be printed.  Save
   this information so that you can reuse this wallet on a later run
   of the counter DApp.

   :::note Wallet SDK v4.0.0 Behavior
   The CLI wallet is built on @midnight-ntwrk/wallet@4.0.0, the same SDK used by the Midnight Lace wallet. This means:
   Wallets are now initialized using a mandatory seed â€” the seed shown in the CLI is critical for restoration.
   :::

   Additionally, your interactions with the DApp, including the wallet
   address and seed, are stored in a `log` subdirectory of
   `counter-cli`.

4. Transfer tokens from your Lace wallet to your CLI wallet:
   - Copy your new wallet's address and open the Midnight Lace wallet
     in your web browser by clicking its icon on the Chrome toolbar.
   - Select **Send** and paste the CLI wallet address into the 'recipient's address' field.
   - Enter an amount to transfer.  The value of 10 tDUST will be more than enough.
   - Review and click **Send**.
   - Enter your wallet password and click **Confirm**.

5. Return to the counter DApp's window and wait for the tokens to be
   received.  The DApp detects the funds that were transferred to
   your CLI wallet and reports your new wallet balance, followed
   by a new prompt.

6. The next prompt asks whether you want to deploy a new counter
   contract on Testnet or join an existing one.  Choose to deploy
   your newly-compiled contract.

   The DApp prints the deployed contract's address.  Save this
   information, so that you can run the DApp again later and rejoin
   the contract.

7. Interact with the contract.  You are prompted with three options: increment, display, or exit.
   - First, display the current value by selecting option 2.  This
     retrieves the current state of the contract from the blockchain
     ledger.  It should report a value of `0`.
   - Next, increment the counter by selecting option 1.  This submits a
     new transaction and awaits confirmation.

     If you watch your proof server's output in another window at the
     same time, you will see that it generates a proof for the
     transaction, which is submitted to Testnet.

     Generating the proof, submitting it to Testnet, and waiting
     for the transaction to be processed by the network takes some
     time.  Eventually, the DApp should report the successful
     completion of the transaction, with output like:
     ```
     Transaction <transaction hash> added in block <block number>
     ```
   - Now verify that the counter's value has been incremented by
     selecting option 2.  It should report a new value of `1`.

   - Repeat as you like, and then select (3) to exit.  There is a problem in one of the underlying libraries
     that can cause error messages upon exit.  You may safely ignore
     these.

8. Try running the DApp again, rebuilding the wallet from the saved
   seed, and rejoining the existing contract.  Have fun playing and
   experimenting.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations,** you are now building and deploying DApps on the Midnight Testnet.
