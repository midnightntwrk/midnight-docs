# Midnight examples archive

Download the Midnight example DApps archive from the
[Releases page](../../../relnotes/dapp-examples).

The examples ZIP file is named `midnight-examples-x.y.z.zip` (where x.y.z is the version) for
some version `x.y.z`.  Unzip the file wherever you would like to build
and test Midnight DApps.  Then go to the top level of
the newly unzipped package.

```shell
unzip midnight-examples-0.1.17.zip
cd midnight-examples-0.1.17
```

## Configure NVM for the examples

In the Midnight examples directory, there is a file `.nvmrc` which
will configure NVM correctly for the purposes of this tutorial.
Verify that your current directory is the `midnight-examples-x.y.z`
directory, and run the following command:

```shell
nvm install
```

You should see output that begins with a line like this:

```
Found <somewhere>/midnight-examples-0.1.17/.nvmrc' with version <lts/hydrogen>
```

and includes a line like this near the end:

```
Now using node v18.19.1 (npm v10.2.4)
```

## Configure Yarn to download Midnight libraries

You will be using Yarn to build Midnight example DApps.  An easy way
to install Yarn, now that you have Node configured, is with the
`corepack` command:

```shell
corepack enable
```

This succeeds silently, but you should see version information now if
you type:

```shell
yarn --version
```

You should see a version number printed, such as `4.1.0`.

The best way to verify this step is to use Yarn to pull the Midnight examples dependencies.  In the top level of your `midnight-examples` folder, simply invoke Yarn with no parameters:

```shell
yarn
```

You should see a lot of output, but no errors, although there may be some warnings.  For example, the last line of output may say `Done with warnings`.

## Configure the Compact compiler path

If you did not add `COMPACT_HOME` to your shell profile after
installing the compiler, or if you have not restarted your shell since
then, execute the following command:

```shell
export COMPACT_HOME='<absolute path to compactc directory>'
```
