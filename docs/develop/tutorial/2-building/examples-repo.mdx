# Midnight examples repository

1. Clone the [Counter Dapp repository](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/example-counter).
2. Go to the root level of the repository.

```shell
cd example-counter
```

3. Run `npm install` in the root folder to install all the necessary packages.

## Configure Yarn to download Midnight libraries

You will be using Yarn to build Midnight example DApps.  An easy way
to install Yarn, now that you have dependencies configured, is with the
`corepack` command:

```shell
corepack enable
```

This succeeds silently, but you should see version information now if
you type:

```shell
yarn --version
```

You should see a version number printed, such as `4.1.0`.

The best way to verify this step is to use Yarn to pull the Midnight examples dependencies.  In the top level of your `example-counter` repository, simply invoke Yarn with no parameters:

```shell
yarn
```

You should see a lot of output, but no errors, although there may be some warnings.  For example, the last line of output may say `Done with warnings`.
