# Build the counter DApp

The focus of part 2 of this tutorial is on using the tools that a
developer needs to create Midnight DApps.  To that end, the example uses
an extremely simple contract, which simply defines a counter and a
circuit to implement it.  To keep the code short enough to
read easily, the counter DApp uses a text-based user interface,
omitting the additional complexities of a web interface.  Later parts
of the tutorial will guide you through the creation of web-based
DApps.

Starting with your current directory as the top-level Midnight
examples directory (such as `midnight-examples-0.1.3`), go to the
counter DApp example:

```shell
cd examples/counter
```

Notice that `counter` contains two sub-directories, each of which is a
separately buildable project.
- `contract` - contains the Compact source for the counter contract,
  plus a tiny amount of associated TypeScript
- `counter-cli` - contains the command-line interface of the DApp and
  depends on the `contract` code.

## Compile the code

Build both sub-projects at once by running the following command in
the `counter` directory above the two sub-directories:

```shell
npx turbo build
```

Successful output looks like this:
```
 Tasks:    4 successful, 4 total
Cached:    0 cached, 4 total
  Time:    8.49s
```

If you see this sort of output, you have compiled a Midnight DApp, and
you are ready to run it.
