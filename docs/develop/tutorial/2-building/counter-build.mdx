# Build the counter DApp

The focus of part 2 of this tutorial is on using the tools that a
developer needs to create Midnight DApps.  To that end, the example uses
an extremely simple contract, which simply defines a counter and a
circuit to implement it.  To keep the code short enough to
read easily, the counter DApp uses a text-based user interface,
omitting the additional complexities of a web interface.  Later parts
of the tutorial will guide you through the creation of web-based
DApps.

At the root level of the `example-counter` repository, notice two sub-directories, each of which is a
separately buildable project.
- `contract` - contains the Compact source for the counter contract,
  plus a tiny amount of associated TypeScript
- `counter-cli` - contains the command-line interface of the DApp and
  depends on the `contract` code.

## Compile the code

1. In the `contract` folder, run this command:

```shell
npm run compactc && npm run build
```

2. Switch to the `counter-cli` folder and run this command:

```shell
npm run start-testnet-remote
```

3. In the `contract` folder, run this command:

```shell
npm run compactc
```

You should see the following output from npm and the Compact compiler:


```
Compactc version: 0.24.0
Compiling 1 circuits:
  circuit "increment" (k=10, rows=29)
Overall progress [====================] 1/1
```

:::note 
The compiler will complete very quickly because we've instructed it to skip ZK key generation with the option `--skip-zk`. The compiler's output files will be placed in the directory `contract/src/managed/counter`.
:::

## Build the TypeScript source files

1. In the `contract` folder, run this command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This creates the `contract/dist` directory.

2. Start unit tests by running:

```shell
npm run test
```

3. In the `counter-cli` folder, run this command:

```shell
npm run build
```

You are now ready to run the Dapp!
