# Proof server

Midnight uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable shielded
transactions and data protection. An essential element of this
architecture is ZK functionality provided by a Midnight *proof
server*, which generates proofs locally that will be verified on-chain. The information that a DApp sends to the proof server includes
private data, such as details of token ownership or a DApp's
private state. To protect your data, you should access only a local
proof server, or perhaps one on a remote machine that you control,
over an encrypted channel.

In this section of the tutorial, you will install and run a Midnight
proof server on your system in a Docker container. The [Lace wallet](/docs/develop/tutorial/1-using/chrome-ext.mdx)
Chrome extension (including the wallet) communicates with the proof
server to invoke ZK functionality and generate ZK proofs for your
transactions.

## Install the proof server

1. In the [prerequisites](./index.mdx) for this part of the tutorial, you
installed Docker and verified your access to the [Midnight Testnet docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/u/midnightnetwork).

   - Via the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker search midnightnetwork
      ```

   - Or by searching `midnightnetwork` in the Docker Desktop search bar.

2. To download the Docker image for the Midnight proof server:

   - Via the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker pull midnightnetwork/proof-server:latest
      ```

      If you need to run an older version of the proof-server, Replace `latest` with the required version of the proof server according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../../relnotes/comp-matrix).

   - Or by clicking **pull** in the search results of the Docker Desktop.


:::tip

By the way, you may not have noticed, but if you hover your mouse
pointer over any of the shell commands or code example boxes in this
tutorial, a *copy* icon (it looks like two overlapping sheets of paper)
appears at the right-hand side of the box. Click that to copy the
contents of the box.

:::

3. You can verify the download's success by checking that the following
command lists a proof server image.

   - Via the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker images | grep proof-server
      ```
    
   - Or by clicking **>_ Terminal**, clicking **Enable Docker terminal** and running the same command as above.


## Start the proof server

In the terminal, run the proof server with the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

You should see some output indicating that the server has started.

## Stop the proof server

To stop the proof server, simply exit the process you launched with
`docker run`. For example, on most systems, you can type `Ctrl-C` to
stop the process.

**For the next step in this tutorial, the proof server must be
running**, so if you have stopped it, start it again now.

## Your privacy

The proof server exists to protect your privacy.  It does not open any
network connections; it simply listens on its assigned port for
requests from your Chrome extension. One of the lines of output you
may see from the proof server includes this text:

```
Targeting network: TestNet
```

This indicates that the instance you are running is configured
appropriately to generate proofs that are valid on the Midnight
Testnet. It does not indicate a network connection from the proof
server to Testnet.

Please let the DevRel support team know if you have any privacy
concerns regarding the proof server.

## Optionally for Linux users: Setup proof-server as a systemd service

For added convenience, you may consider running the proof-server as an automatic background process anytime you boot your machine.

1. Create a new file for your systemd service, typically in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/midnight-proof-server.service
```

2. Add the following contents.

```
[Unit]
Description=Midnight Network Proof Server
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Adjust the `Description`, `ExecStart`, and other parameters as needed.

3. Reload systemd manager to apply changes.

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. **Start** service.
```
sudo systemctl start midnight-proof-server # start service
```

5. How to **stop** and get **status** of service.

```shell
sudo systemctl enable midnight-proof-server # stop service

sudo systemctl status midnight-proof-server # get status of service
```
