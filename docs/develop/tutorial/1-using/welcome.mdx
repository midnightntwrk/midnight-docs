# Welcome to the Midnight Testnet

By now you have:
- A Lace wallet
- Some amount of tDUST assigned to that wallet, and
- A proof server running locally.

You are ready to perform your first transaction on the Midnight Testnet.

1. Copy your best friend's receiving address or the address below and send exactly 1.0 tDUST.

```
mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9
```

:::note Address Format Reminder
The example address above uses the legacy HEX format. If you're copying a receiving address from the Lace wallet, it will be in Bech32m format by default. For example: `mn_shield-addr_test1kjwksfp8x2tachehsfvufsdl35ljg5cxzdcysjdn6ntadspyxn3qxqrxypgjm055c2azrpuyn7un0ge2vm25vkfv38d24rj3ewcku5wmdc94gjr9`

âœ¨ At this point you've completed your first Midnight Testnet transaction. Now, let's build some DApps!
