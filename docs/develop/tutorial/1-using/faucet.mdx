# Token acquisition

In the production Midnight network, anyone running a DApp would need
to hold some DUST in a persistent wallet and spend some of it on each
transaction.  On the testnet, however, a supply of free tDUST is
available for developers who want to experiment with Midnight DApps.

## Get tDUST

1. Copy your receiving address from your Lace wallet.

  :::note Bech32m Address Format
  All wallet addresses are shown in Bech32m format by default. The faucet supports both formats, however the legacy (HEX) format will be dropped in future versions.
  :::

2. Visit the [Midnight testnet faucet ðŸš°](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/) and enter your wallet address.
3. Select **Request tokens**. This may take a few seconds to process and will return something like:

`Transaction submitted. Its ID is 1644b988ac71dc6bd6...`

4. You should have received 1000.0 tDUST from the faucet.
