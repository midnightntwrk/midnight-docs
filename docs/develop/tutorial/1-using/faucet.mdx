# Token acquisition

In the production Midnight network, anyone running a DApp would need
to hold some Dust in a persistent wallet and spend some of it on each
transaction.  On the testnet, however, a supply of free tDUST is
available for developers who want to experiment with Midnight DApps.

## Get some tDUST

1. Copy your receiving address from your Midnight Lace wallet.

  :::note Bech32m Address Format
  As of Midnight Lace Wallet v2.0.0 and Wallet SDK v4.0.0, all wallet addresses are shown in Bech32m format by default. The faucet supports both formats, however the legacy (HEX) format will be dropped in future versions.

2. Visit the [Midnight testnet faucet ðŸš°](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/) and enter your wallet address.
3. Select 'Request tokens'. This may take a few seconds to process and will return something like:

*Transaction submitted. Its ID is 1644b988ac71dc6bd6...*

4. You should have received 1000.0 tDUST from the faucet.
