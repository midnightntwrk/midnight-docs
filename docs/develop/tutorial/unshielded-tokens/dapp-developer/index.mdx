# Midnight dApp developer tutorials

Unshielded Tokens (UTs) on Midnight are public, UTxO‑based assets. Your dApp reads balances and activity from the Indexer by address, authorizes sends via the user’s wallet using Schnorr/secp256k1 signatures, and targets bech32m payment addresses. Network fees are paid in Dust, so any standard transaction you initiate must account for a Dust spend in the guaranteed section.

A UT transfer is carried in a standard transaction as an unshielded offer (inputs, outputs, signatures) within an intent. Intents are bound with commitments/randomness to prevent unintended malleability while allowing controlled merging. The guaranteed section must succeed and carries the Dust fee payment. Your dApp composes intent data or invokes a wallet capability, then observes confirmations through the Indexer.

Use the Indexer (HTTP/WS) to discover the user’s UTxOs, token balances, and transaction statuses. Invoke the user’s wallet to construct and sign transfers; submit over the relay or via wallet infrastructure, then reflect state changes as the Indexer streams updates. When interacting with contracts, include the contract call in the same standard transaction as your UT movement and let the wallet balance fees with Dust.
