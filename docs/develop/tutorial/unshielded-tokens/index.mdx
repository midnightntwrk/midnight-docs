# Midnight Unshielded Tokens (UT) tutorials

This section is the starting point for working with Unshielded Tokens (UTs) in Midnight. It orients both dApp developers and wallet builders to the specific tutorials you will use to integrate UTs end to end.

UTs are public, UTxO‑based assets. You obtain balances from the user’s UTxOs, authorize spends with `Schnorr/secp256k1` signatures, and address recipients using `bech32m` payment addresses. All standard transactions pay fees in Dust, so even UT‑only sends include a Dust spend in the guaranteed section.
