# Midnight wallet builder tutorials

Unshielded Tokens (UTs) on Midnight are public, UTxO‑based assets. Spending is authorized with `Schnorr/secp256k1` signatures; recipients use `bech32m` payment addresses. Balances are computed from the user’s UTxO set obtained from the Indexer. All standard transactions pay fees in Dust, so every UT send includes a Dust spend in the guaranteed section.

A UT transfer is encoded as an unshielded offer (inputs, outputs, signatures) inside an intent of a standard transaction. Intents are bound with commitments/randomness to prevent unintended malleability while still allowing controlled merging. The guaranteed section must succeed and carries the Dust fee payment.

Use the unshielded wallet to manage UTxOs and produce input signatures. Use the dust wallet to fund and construct Dust spends. Shielded components are present for transaction binding and cohesion; you typically access all three via the wallet facade. Sync against the Indexer (HTTP/WS) to discover, confirm, and finalize UTxOs; submit over the relay (WS).
