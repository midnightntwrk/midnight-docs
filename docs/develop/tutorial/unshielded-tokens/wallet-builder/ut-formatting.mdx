# Formatting and sending Unshielded Token (UT) transfers

Unshielded token (UT) transactions in Midnight are UTxO-based and involve the following components:

* **Inputs**: References to existing UTxOs (unspent transaction outputs) that the sender controls.
* **Outputs**: New UTxOs specifying the recipient’s unshielded address, token type, and amount.
* **Signatures**: Authorizations for spending the inputs, signing over the entire transaction intent.

## Unshielded output structure

* **Amount**: Number of indivisible units to transfer.
* **Token type**: The specific UT being sent.
* **Recipient**: The unshielded address of the receiver.

## Unshielded offer structure:

* List of inputs (UTxOs to spend)
* List of outputs (new UTxOs to create)
* Signatures for the inputs

## SDK methods for UT transfers

The Midnight Wallet SDK provides high-level methods to facilitate UT transfers. The main method is `transferTransaction()`, which prepares a transaction for sending tokens.

### Preparing a transfer transaction

Use the `transferTransaction()` method, providing an array of transfer objects with the following properties:

* **amount**: BigInt – the amount to send
* **type**: TokenType – the UT type (e.g., `nativeToken()` for tDUST)
* **receiverAddress**: Address – the recipient’s unshielded address

Example:

```compact
import { nativeToken } from '@midnight-ntwrk/zswap';

const transferRecipe = await wallet.transferTransaction([
  {
    amount: 1n,
    receiverAddress: '<unshielded-wallet-address>',
    type: nativeToken() // tDUST token type
  }
]);
```

### Balancing the transaction

After preparing the transaction, you must balance it to ensure all inputs and outputs match and fees are covered:

```
const balancedRecipe = await wallet.balanceTransaction(transferRecipe);
```

### Proving and submitting the transaction

Once balanced, generate the necessary zero-knowledge proofs and submit:

```
const provenTransaction = await wallet.proveTransaction(balancedRecipe);
const submittedTransaction = await wallet.submitTransaction(provenTransaction);
```

### Summary

1. Prepare the transfer using `transferTransaction()` with the recipient’s unshielded address, token type, and amount.
2. Balance the transaction with `balanceTransaction()` to ensure all values and fees are correct.
3. Prove and submit the transaction using `proveTransaction()` and `submitTransaction()`.
