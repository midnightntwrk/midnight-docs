# The Compact language

At this point, you should have already seen Compact, our smart contract
programming language, in action in [the tutorial](/docs/develop/tutorial/index.mdx) and some
usage hints in [the 'how Midnight works'](/docs/develop/how-midnight-works/index.mdx) sections.

This section will provide a more in-depth breakdown of what makes up a Compact
smart contract, starting with
[a walkthrough of the main parts of a Compact program](/docs/develop/reference/compact/writing.mdx),
followed by [a reference for the Compact language](/docs/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref.mdx) and 
[the Compact standard library API reference](/docs/develop/reference/compact/compact-std-library/README.md).

The formal grammar for Compact and a specification of the API for
`ledger` datatypes are available, as well (both externally generated):
- [Compact formal grammar](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/compact/lang-ref)
- [Ledger data types](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/reference/midnight-api/compact-runtime/)
