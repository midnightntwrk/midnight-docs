# Visual Studio Code extension for Compact

The [Visual Studio Code extension] for Compact is a plugin
that assists with writing and debugging smart contracts written in Midnight's Compact language.

DApp developers can create new smart contracts
* using a file template
* from scratch, optionally using code snippets.

## Features

### Syntax highlighting

Smart contracts are written in the Compact language.  The following language elements
will be recognized and formatted:
* Compact keywords, such as `enum`, `struct`, and `circuit`
* string, boolean, and numeric literals
* comments
* parentheses

### Building Compact source files and error highlighting

For building smart contracts, you will typically want to add a script definition in `package.json`, like so:
```json
"scripts": {
  "compact": "compactc --vscode ./src/myContract.compact ./src/managed/myContract"
}
```
The preceding assumes that the Compact compiler is on the shell's command search path 
(if it isn't, follow the instructions provided in [Running Midnight Compact compiler](../../../../develop/tutorial/building/counter-build#compile-the-code)). It also uses the Compact compiler's --vscode option to omit newlines in error messages, so that they render properly inside the VS Code environment.

This allows you to compile your smart contract using:
```shell
yarn compact
```

When you edit complex contracts, and you want to have fast interactions, it is more convenient to 
add a [task file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) `.vscode/tasks.json` configured like this:
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Compile compact file to JS",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npx compactc --vscode --skip-zk ${file} ${workspaceFolder}/src/managed",
      "group": "build",
      "presentation": {
        "echo": true,
        "reveal": "never",
        "focus": false,
        "panel": "shared",
        "showReuseMessage": false,
        "clear": true,
        "revealProblems": "onProblem"
      },
      "problemMatcher": [
        "$compactException",
        "$compactInternal",
        "$compactCommandNotFound"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The preceding configuration uses the
Compact compiler flag `--skip-zk` to skip the generation of circuits,
which can take a long time and may be unnecessary when you only want
to the compiler to check your syntax.

Moreover, you can configure a `problemMatcher` for VS Code:
```json
 "problemMatcher": [
     "$compactException",
     "$compactInternal",
     "$compactCommandNotFound"
 ]
```
so that all errors reported by the compiler will be shown on the **Problems** tab.

### Code snippets

The VS Code extension provides the following [code snippets](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) when editing Compact smart contracts:
* `ledger` (`state`)
* `constructor` in ledger
* potentially exported `circuit` (`function` / `transition`)
* `witness` (`private` function)
* constructor
* import Compact `standard library` (`init`, `stdlib`)
* `if` statement (`cond`)
* `map` (`for`)
* `fold`
* `enum`
* `struct`
* `module`
* `assert`
* `pragma`

There is also a `compact` template, which will generate a simple Compact skeleton for a contract.

### New Compact smart contract

If you are creating DApp, you can create a new smart contract 
with an empty ledger and a single circuit as follows:
1. Bring up the commands pallette (Cmd+Shift+P).
2. Select **Snippets: Fill File with Snippet**.
3. Select **Compact**.
Be aware: if you perform these steps in an existing file, the contents of the file are overwritten.
Other snippets are available from inside the file. Just start typing the name of the function.
