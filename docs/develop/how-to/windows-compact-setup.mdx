---

This comprehensive guide shows you how to establish a robust, fully functional Windows development environment specifically tailored for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the Midnight Network. We will walk you through the essential setup steps, including the installation and configuration of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), Docker Desktop, and the Midnight Lace wallet.

By the time you complete this expanded tutorial, you will have a production-ready environment capable of receiving essential Testnet tokens (tDUST), running the core Midnight Dev proof server, and seamlessly interacting with the Midnight Testnet. Adhering to these detailed steps ensures your development workflow is optimized and aligned with best practices for efficient and secure development on Midnight.

## Install and configure the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Developing DApps for the Midnight network often requires compiling and running various components (like the proof server or complex scripts) that are traditionally Linux-based. The Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a critical component that allows you to run a native Linux environment directly within Windows without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine.

Step-by-step installation:

Open the Start Menu on your Windows desktop.

Search for Windows PowerShell (or Command Prompt) and right-click on the result. Select "Run as administrator." This elevation is necessary to install system-level features like WSL.

![[Windows Start menu with PowerShell right-click menu showing Run as administrator](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/azunze475qiad8qvnmea.png)

In the command terminal, enter the following streamlined installation command:

```bash
wsl --install -d ubuntu
```

![PowerShell terminal executing the wsl installation command](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/udzzpfa7fmvnkerruifw.png)

This command performs three primary functions automatically:
It enables the required Windows features for WSL (Virtual Machine Platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux).
It downloads and installs the recommended Ubuntu distribution (the default and most widely supported Linux environment).

![Ubuntu distribution download and installation progress in the terminal](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/15y290h3vgsdliqmbc69.png)

It restarts the necessary services.

:::info
The initial download and installation of the required components and the Ubuntu image can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your internet connection and system speed. Do not close the window until the process is complete.
:::

After the installation is finished, a new Ubuntu terminal window will open automatically. You will be prompted to create a UNIX Username and a Password.

:::note
When entering your password, the characters will not be displayed on the screen for security reasons (this is standard Linux terminal behavior). Type your desired password carefully and press Enter.
:::

Once successfully configured, your new username will be displayed as part of your terminal prompt (for example, `yourusername@DESKTOP-XXXXXX:~$`).

This confirms that WSL is correctly installed and the Ubuntu distribution is ready for use.

Verification and Best Practices:

To ensure WSL is running the correct version, you can execute this command in the Windows PowerShell:

```
Bash
wsl -l -v
```
You should see a list showing Ubuntu and confirming its STATE is Running (or Stopped) and its VERSION is 2 (WSL 2 is required for optimal performance and Docker integration).

## Install and Configure Docker Desktop
Docker is indispensable for Midnight development because the core components, particularly the Midnight Proof Server, are distributed as Docker images. Docker containers provide an isolated, consistent environment, ensuring the proof server runs exactly the same way regardless of your local system configuration.

Installation Process:

Open your preferred web browser and navigate to the official Docker website at [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

![Official Docker Desktop download page for Windows](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tbyf3h7vt6seaff0yuma.png)

Look for the Docker Desktop for Windows download link. Ensure you download the installer that matches your CPU architecture (for example, `Windows - AMD64` for modern systems).

Run the downloaded installer (for example, `Docker Desktop Installer.exe`). During the installation, make sure the box for "Install required Windows components for WSL 2" is checked. This is vital for Docker to integrate seamlessly with the Linux environment you just set up.

Follow the prompts to complete the installation. A system restart may be required.

After the reboot, launch Docker Desktop from your Start Menu. It will take a few moments to start up, showing the whale icon in your system tray.

Verification and Integration:
Once Docker Desktop is running, open the Settings menu within Docker Desktop (the gear icon).

Navigate to the Resources > WSL Integration tab.

Ensure that the "Enable integration with my default WSL distro" option is toggled ON, and specifically verify that your Ubuntu distribution is enabled. This connection allows Docker to manage containers directly from your Linux terminal later in Section 6.

## Install and configure the Midnight Lace wallet

The Lace wallet is the primary interface for users and developers to interact with the Midnight Testnet. It allows you to manage your Testnet tokens (tDUST) and authorize transactions. 

:::tip Lace wallet setup
Because the process for setting up the wallet is the same across all operating systems, please follow the official [Lace wallet guide](https://docs.midnight.network/develop/how-to/lace-wallet) to install the extension and secure your recovery phrase.
:::

## Acquire tDUST from the faucet

tDUST (Testnet DUST) is the utility token of the Midnight Testnet. You need a small amount of tDUST to pay for transaction fees and interact with the Midnight proof server.

To acquire tokens:
1. Copy your Lace wallet address from the extension.
2. Navigate to the [Midnight Testnet Faucet](https://faucet.preview.midnight.network/).
3. Paste your address and select **Request token**.

Once you have received your tDUST, return to this guide to finish the Windows-specific configuration.

## Set up and Run the Midnight Proof Server with Docker

The Midnight Proof Server is the core component that your DApps will communicate with to execute zero-knowledge proofs and transactions. It is run via Docker for consistency. The final, critical step is to download the server image and run it, ensuring it correctly targets the Midnight Testnet.

Downloading the Docker Image:

Open your Docker Desktop application.

![Docker Desktop application dashboard interface](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ylagdt2xu3tvyzt3qvr2.png)

Navigate to the "Explore" section (or the search field if available).

Insert the official repository name: midnightnetwork (no spaces).

![Docker Desktop Explore tab with midnightnetwork entered in the search bar](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/jh4zbv0a1d589lelj8wq.png)

Select the first official result that corresponds to the proof server image.

Click "Pull" (or the download icon) beside the proof server image to automatically download the latest version from the repository.

![Pulling the official midnightnetwork proof-server image in Docker](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q73g1rr3mq7j80u0rol1.png)

After the download is complete, click on "Images" on the left-hand navigation menu within Docker Desktop. You should see the `midnightnetwork/proof-server` image listed.

![ocker Desktop Images tab showing the downloaded proof-server image](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/pmmocxc6tumxqr7k4801.png)

Running and Configuring for Testnet:

When you click "Run" within Docker Desktop, the proof server starts, but it defaults to targeting an undeployed (local, private) network configuration.

![Docker container run settings showing default configuration](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/ad1i9c6a20o2c064twr3.png)

To make it useful for development, we must explicitly configure it to connect to the Midnight Testnet.

Return to the Midnight Developer documentation.

Navigate to the relevant tutorial: "Midnight Developer Tutorial" > "Tutorial 1.3 Proof Server".

Scroll down to the "Start the proof server" sub-section. The documentation provides a specific command optimized for connecting to the Testnet. Copy this exact command. It will look similar to a standard docker run command but with specific environment flags attached.

![Midnight documentation showing the optimized proof-server run command](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1ge5pdrj0vfb05r4dxn7.png)

Open Windows PowerShell (or your WSL terminal, if preferred).

Paste the command you copied in the previous step and press Enter.

![Terminal window showing the proof-server successfully running on the Midnight Testnet](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/2az3h2i0nv57mfmohfd7.png)

This command will instruct Docker to launch the proof server container, map the necessary ports, and most importantly, set the environment variables that force it to target the public Midnight Testnet nodes.

## Install the Compact compiler

Compact is Midnight's smart contract language. Since you are using a Windows machine, you must install the compiler inside your **WSL Ubuntu terminal** to ensure it works with the rest of the Midnight toolchain.

1. Open your Ubuntu terminal (WSL).
2. Run the following command to install the Compact binaries:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/download/compact-v0.2.0/compact-installer.sh | sh

```

3. The installer script automatically updates your path. To apply these changes to your current session, reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc

```

4. Verify the installation by checking the version:

```bash
compact --version

```

5. Update to the latest version to ensure you have the most recent features:

```bash
compact update

```

## Install the Compact VS Code extension

The Compact VS Code extension provides syntax highlighting and real-time error checking, which is essential for writing smart contracts.

1. Download the latest VSIX package from the [Compact VS Code extension release page](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases).
2. Open **VS Code**.
3. Go to the **Extensions** view (press `Ctrl+Shift+X`), click the **...** (More Actions) menu at the top-right of the extensions pane, and select **Install from VSIX...**.
4. Select the `.vsix` file you just downloaded to complete the installation.


## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully setup Midnight's development tools on your Windows machine using WSL.

Now that your environment is ready, you can begin building. Head over to the [Compact documentation](https://docs.midnight.network/compact) to start writing your first smart contracts using the Compact programming language.
