          <strong>Ledgers</strong> store state.
          Midnight keeps a public ledger for visible data and a private ledger for shielded data.
          This shows <em>where state is stored and who can see it</em>.

        <td><strong>How value moves</strong></td>
        <td>
          <strong>The UTXO model</strong> defines spendable pieces of value or state.
          Midnight extends this model with private state elements.
          This shows <em>how value flows through the system</em>.

Midnight uses zero-knowledge proofs to keep sensitive data private while still verifying contract logic. Its smart contracts operate across public and private ledgers, reducing transaction correlation and supporting secure, confidential on-chain atomic swaps of tokens and metadata.
