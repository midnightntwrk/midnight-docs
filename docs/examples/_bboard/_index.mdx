# Create a new DApp

Learn how to:

- Write a contract that works with both public and private data
- Fill in the missing parts of the DApp code, to create a complete and working DApp
- Run a Midnight node that is *disconnected* from the Midnight Testnet, for testing purposes
- Switch from a test configuration to a production configuration and
   use your new DApp on Testnet.
