# Run a Midnight node in Validator Mode

## Prerequisites

- `Postgres` PORT should be accessible to the `midnight-node` and `cardano-db-sync` should be fully synced (Step 2).

- `Midnight-node` is available as a Docker image *at this time*. Therefore, Docker/ Docker Compose is required.
    - [Installing Docker/ Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

- `data/chains/partner_chains_template/...` (created in Step 3) is available to the Midnight-node (via a docker volume).
- Install `direnv` to manage environment variables.

If `data/chains/partner_chains_template/...` is still on the partner-chains deps server, then simply copy it over to the Midnight-node instance.

<details>
<summary><b>Optional: Copying files between instances using Magic Wormhole</b></summary>

Install
```shell
sudo apt install magic-wormhole # install magic wormhole on each instance.

wormhole send data/ # returns a receive command to copy and paste on the other instance

# on the intended midnight-node copy the receive command

wormhole receive <secret words>

# verify the directory and contents were copied over
sudo apt install tree
tree data/
```
</details>

## Clone the `midnight-node-docker` repo and setup Partner-chain keys

- Clone [midnight-node-docker](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/midnight-node-docker)
- Copy `data/chains/partner_chains_template/...` into the root directory of the project like so:

```shell
midnight-node-docker$ tree -d data/
data/
└── data
    └── chains
        └── partner_chains_template
            ├── keystore
            └── network
```

**`docker-compose up` midnight-node**:

- Within the same directory as `compose.yml`, simply invoke `docker compose up` to start the node.

    ```shell
    docker-compose up
    # docker-compose up -d to run in detached mode
    ```

The node should begin to sync with the testnet.

```shell
⚙️ Syncing  2.6 bps, target=#474962 (8 peers), best: #3967 (0xf620…d752), finalized #3584 (0x56d5…f7bd), ⬇ 0.8kiB/s ⬆ 0.2kiB/s
```

In the above log example; the node is syncing and peering with the network (8). The current synced block is 3967, but the sync target is 474962.

:::note

Your node will be eligable to produce blocks in n + 2 epochs since registration. For example, if you register on epoch 900 and start a validator node on epoch 901, then you won't see blocks being produced until the chain is at epoch 902.

:::

When the node is fully synced, then you should be participating in block production. For example:

```shell
✨ Imported #12345 (0xabc1…def2)
💤 Idle (5 peers), best: #12345 (0xabc1…def2), finalized #12343 (0x789a…bcd3)
🏆 Prepared block for proposing at #12346 (block time = 6s)
🔖 Pre-sealed block for proposal at #12346. Hash: 0xdef3…ghi4
✨ Successfully proposed block #12346 (0xdef3…ghi4)
✨ Imported #12346 (0xdef3…ghi4)
💤 Idle (5 peers), best: #12346 (0xdef3…ghi4), finalized #12344 (0x456b…def7)
```

- "Prepared block for proposing": This line indicates that your node has prepared a block to propose at a specific block height (e.g., #12346). This is a strong sign that your node is actively participating in block production.
- "Pre-sealed block for proposal": This shows the block is ready to be proposed to the network, including its hash.
- "Successfully proposed block": This confirms that your node successfully proposed the block to the network.
- "Imported": This means the block your node produced (or another block at that height) has been imported into the chain. If the hash matches your proposed block, it’s a clear sign your node’s block was accepted.
- Block Number Incrementing: If the best block number keeps increasing and aligns with your proposed blocks, your node is contributing to the chain’s progress.
