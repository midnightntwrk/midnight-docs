# Use cases

Use case examples are just some of the ways Midnight can serve the world. Midnight will not solve the problems directly. It provides features that make solutions possible. All of these use cases require the development of one or more decentralized applications (DApps).

Midnight enables these solutions with innovative features:

-   [Midnight smart contracts](/docs/develop/how-midnight-works/smart-contracts.mdx) can manage two states at once; a private [state](/docs/learn/04-glossary.mdx#state) on a local machine, and the public state that exists on the public blockchain
-   Smart contracts are written in [Compact](/docs/learn/04-glossary.mdx#compact), a language based on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   A Microsoft Visual Studio Code plugin means that this free, powerful, familiar IDE can be used in development
-   Zero-knowledge proofs in Midnight use [ZK Snarks](/docs/learn/04-glossary.mdx#zk-snarks), a highly efficient form of ZK proof
-   Midnightâ€™s ZK proofs allow selective disclosure of information while preventing leakage of information that could benefit malicious actors.
