# Decentralized anonymous voting

Currently, a voter has to provide identification to prove that they are qualified to vote and have not voted before. That identification may carry other information such as a home address, date of birth, proof of funds in a certain currency, or a simple attestation from a blockchain wallet that the voter might not want to reveal publicly.

Blockchain technology provides infrastructure that reduces the opportunity for tampering. And with a DApp using Midnightâ€™s zero-knowledge technology, voters or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) voting on behalf of its members can prove what they need to without disclosing unnecessary information. The implications are wide-ranging and profound.
