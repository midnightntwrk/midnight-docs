# Enhancing AI and LLM

The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in recent times is undeniable. Yet, a significant portion of their capabilities relies on training data, which is sourced from publicly available artifacts:

-   Firstly, some AIs might use proprietary or licensed content with no means, currently, to fairly attribute usage or royalties.
-   Secondly, as more AI-generated content is produced online, there will be more concern about the authenticity of the work and whether it is based on genuine human or credentialed contributors.
-   And finally, LLMs could be enhanced by providing access to private or proprietary datasets that are particularly rich, but that the owners are unwilling or legally unable to share with third parties.
    
To address these challenges, Midnight can help establish secure and private interactions with AI and LLMs to safeguard the confidentiality of data models and enhance the reliability and quality of outcomes, while maintaining the data privacy of sources as required by law.
