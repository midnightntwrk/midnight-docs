# Enhanced developer experience

Whether you're building new applications or retrofitting existing ones, Midnight aims to make the integration of data protection technology like ZK simple and accessible to a wide developer base.

Developing DApps can be challenging, especially when it comes to ensuring security and data protection. Midnight offers an innovative programming model that simplifies the process. Developers familiar with TypeScript will be comfortable writing DApps on Midnight. Most of the business logic and front-end code is written in this well-known language, and critical contract elements are written in Compact, a domain-specific language specifically designed to integrate seamlessly with TypeScript. 

In addition, a plug-in for Microsoft VS Code provides developers with a smooth and efficient experience. The Midnight SDK provides all the necessary tools to build and run software, including the compiler and runtime, as well as a mocked node, CLI wallet, and example projects.

Overall, Midnightâ€™s developer experience features offer a powerful environment for developers to create data-protecting smart contracts with ease, providing the necessary tools to build and run software and allowing for seamless integration.
