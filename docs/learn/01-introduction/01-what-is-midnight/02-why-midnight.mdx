# Why Midnight

Midnight helps counteract worldwide threats to three fundamental freedoms: association, commerce, and expression (ACE).

These ACE freedoms drive Midnight’s philosophy and use cases:

The world needs technology that supports and protects these freedoms instead of threatening them. When people do not have these basic freedoms, they are unable to connect to the rest of the world.
 
Midnight provides technology that empowers individuals to associate with their chosen peers. Decentralized identity is core to Midnight interactions, as it empowers users to:
 
* Hold and control their data, maintaining confidentiality where needed.
* Share relevant assertions about identity publicly while keeping personally identifiable information private.
 
 
Midnight aims to balance individuals' rights and societal safety by enabling secure and private interactions while supporting compliance and free expression:
 
* Protect people's right to engage in lawful activities without the fear of being monitored.
* Safeguard society from malicious individuals through robust security features.
* Enable secure commercial transactions with minimal risk of theft or persecution.
* Facilitate compliance with applicable laws for both users and commercial marketplaces.
* Provide a platform for free expression without fear of censorship.
* Ensure personally identifiable information remains private while allowing cryptographic assertions for trust and transparency.
