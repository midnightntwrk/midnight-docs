# What is Midnight?

Midnight is a data protection blockchain platform developed by Input Output Global (IOG), the engineering company behind Cardano. It addresses a fundamental challenge in blockchain technology: how to leverage the benefits of distributed ledgers while maintaining the privacy required for sensitive data.

Unlike traditional blockchains where every transaction is permanently visible to all participants, Midnight introduces selective disclosure - the ability to prove facts about data without revealing the data itself. This breakthrough enables blockchain adoption in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, and government services where data protection is not just important, but legally required.

## Core concepts

### Data protection blockchain

Midnight operates as a partner chain to Cardano, inheriting its security model while adding privacy capabilities. The platform maintains two parallel states:

- **Public state**: Traditional blockchain data stored on-chain, visible to all network participants. This includes transaction proofs, contract code, and any intentionally public information.

- **Private state**: Encrypted data stored locally by users, never exposed to the network. This includes personal information, business data, and any sensitive content that must remain confidential.


### Zero-knowledge proofs

The bridge between public and private states is zero-knowledge cryptography. Using zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), Midnight can:
- Verify computations without seeing the input data
- Prove statements are true without revealing why they're true
- Generate compact proofs (128 bytes) regardless of computation complexity
- Validate proofs in milliseconds on-chain

For example, a healthcare application can prove a patient qualifies for treatment without revealing their medical history, or a financial system can verify sufficient account balance without exposing the actual amount.


### Compact programming language

Midnight introduces Compact, a domain-specific language based on TypeScript that makes privacy-preserving smart contracts accessible to mainstream developers. Instead of requiring cryptographic expertise, developers write familiar code that automatically compiles to zero-knowledge circuits:

```typescript
export contract PrivateAuction {
  @ledger public winner: PublicKey;           // Public winner announcement
  @ledger public winningBid: Field;           // Public winning amount
  @local secret bids: Map<PublicKey, Field>;  // Private bid amounts
  
  @circuit submitBid(amount: Field) {
    // Bid logic executes privately
    this.bids.set(msg.sender, amount);
  }
  
  @circuit revealWinner() {
    // Determine winner without exposing all bids
    // Only winning bid becomes public
  }
}
```

## Why Midnight

  <FlipCard 
    title="Regulatory compliance is non-negotiable"
    frontContent="Data protection laws now carry penalties that can destroy businesses. GDPR fines reach €20 million or 4% of global revenue. HIPAA violations cost up to $2 million per year. Traditional public blockchains make compliance impossible."
    backContent="The regulatory landscape includes GDPR (Europe) with fines up to €20M or 4% of revenue, CCPA (California) at $7,500 per violation, HIPAA (Healthcare) up to $2M per violation/year, and PIPEDA (Canada) with unlimited penalties. Midnight's solution enables selective disclosure for compliance reporting without data exposure. Organizations can prove they meet requirements, generate audit trails, and respond to regulatory requests while keeping sensitive data encrypted."

  <FlipCard 
    title="Current blockchain choices"
    frontContent="Organizations need blockchain's trust and immutability but cannot expose customer data, trade secrets, or competitive intelligence. Existing solutions force them to choose between transparency and privacy."
    backContent="The blockchain trilemma presents three unsatisfactory options: Public chains offer full transparency but no privacy, making them unusable for sensitive data. Private chains provide privacy but sacrifice decentralization, defeating blockchain's purpose. Hybrid attempts are complex, fragmented, and lack interoperability. Midnight breaks this trilemma by providing one platform with both public and private state, maintaining decentralization while enabling privacy through zero-knowledge proofs."

    title="Privacy technology requires certain expertise"
    frontContent="Zero-knowledge cryptography is complex. Most developers lack the specialized knowledge to build privacy-preserving applications, creating a massive barrier to adoption."
    backContent="Traditional ZK development requires understanding of algebraic circuits, knowledge of cryptographic primitives, expertise in proof systems, and months of specialized learning. Midnight changes this by letting developers write TypeScript-like code in Compact. The compiler handles circuit generation, proof system integration, and cryptographic operations automatically. Any developer familiar with TypeScript can build privacy-preserving applications immediately."

## How Midnight works

### Transaction flow

When a user initiates a transaction on Midnight, the process follows a specific sequence to maintain privacy while ensuring validity. First, users perform computations on their private data locally, never exposing it to the network. The Midnight runtime then generates a zero-knowledge proof of this computation, creating mathematical evidence that the computation was performed correctly without revealing the inputs.

This proof, along with any intended public outputs, is submitted to the blockchain. Network validators verify the proof using the zk-SNARK verification algorithm, which takes only milliseconds despite the complexity of the original computation. Once verified, both public and private states update according to the proven computation - public state on the blockchain and private state in users' local storage.

### Network architecture

Midnight operates as a proof-of-stake blockchain with 20-second block times, using the Ouroboros consensus mechanism inherited from Cardano. Validators can participate permissionlessly through stake delegation, contributing to network security while earning rewards. The platform maintains a native bridge to Cardano for asset transfers, enabling interoperability between the two chains.

The network processes two types of transactions: standard public transactions that function like traditional blockchain operations, and shielded transactions that use zero-knowledge proofs to maintain privacy. Both transaction types are validated by the same set of validators, ensuring consistent security across the network.

### Privacy guarantees

Midnight implements several layers of privacy protection. The system follows data minimization principles, ensuring only essential data goes on-chain while sensitive information remains in local storage. Forward secrecy protects historical data - even if encryption keys are compromised in the future, past transactions remain private.

Users maintain complete control through selective disclosure, choosing precisely what information to reveal and to whom. For regulated entities, Midnight provides optional compliance mechanisms that enable required reporting to authorities without compromising user privacy or exposing data to unauthorized parties.
