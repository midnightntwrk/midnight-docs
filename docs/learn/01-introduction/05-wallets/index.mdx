# Wallets

Midnight aims to allow users to securely interact with [DApps](/docs/learn/04-glossary.mdx#dapp) and transact with other individuals through the use of Web3 wallets. Web3 wallets are fundamental tools in the decentralized ecosystem, acting as secure interfaces for managing digital assets and interactions.

Just as physical wallets store banknotes and coins, digital wallets securely store private keys—unique cryptographic credentials that grant access to a user’s assets and permissions within a decentralized network. These private keys act as digital signatures, authenticating and authorizing transactions.

To illustrate:

- **Private keys** are like the master keys to your digital identity and assets. Losing them is akin to losing access to a vault.
- **Permissions** govern what your wallet can do, ensuring actions such as sending funds or signing a contract are deliberate and secure.

By securely managing private keys and permissions, wallets enable users to control their digital identities, access and manage assets, and interact confidently with DApps and other services. This empowers individuals to navigate the decentralized landscape with enhanced security and privacy, making Web3 interactions intuitive and safe.
