# The underlying technology

Midnightâ€™s technology empowers data protection by utilizing zero-knowledge technology, particularly ZK Snarks, to protect sensitive data and metadata. Through Midnight smart contracts, decentralized apps can access both public and private ledgers, ensuring transparency while safeguarding sensitive data on users' devices. Unlike other privacy blockchains, Midnight smart contracts and ZK Snarks prevent tracking and correlation of on-chain transactions, facilitating DApps that comply with regulations by customizing data protection. Midnight also introduces Zswap, the ledger that supports secure and protected atomic swaps of tokens and metadata in on-chain transactions.
