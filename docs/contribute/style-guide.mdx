# Midnight documentation style guide

This comprehensive style guide establishes writing and formatting standards for all Midnight technical documentation. It ensures consistency, clarity, and accessibility across our documentation ecosystem.

:::info Based on industry standards
This guide builds upon the [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/) and [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style). For general formatting and style questions not covered here, refer to these industry-standard resources. This guide focuses on Midnight-specific conventions and blockchain terminology.
:::

## Core writing principles

### Active voice and direct language

Use active voice consistently to create clear, actionable content.

| ✓ Preferred | ✗ Avoid |
|-------------|---------|
| Install the Lace wallet extension | The Lace wallet extension should be installed |
| The proof server generates zero-knowledge proofs | Zero-knowledge proofs are generated by the proof server |
| Deploy your smart contract to testnet | Your smart contract should be deployed to testnet |

### Present tense and immediate instructions

Write instructions in present tense as if the user is performing actions now.

| ✓ Preferred | ✗ Avoid |
|-------------|---------|
| Click the send button. | You will click the send button. |
| The transaction completes successfully. | The transaction will complete successfully. |
| Your wallet displays the balance. | Your wallet will display the balance. |

### Sentence case convention

Use sentence case for all headings, titles, and labels to maintain consistency and accessibility.

| ✓ Preferred | ✗ Avoid |
|-------------|---------|
| Getting started with Midnight | Getting Started With Midnight |
| Building your first DApp | Building Your First DApp |
| API reference guide | API Reference Guide |

### User-centered language

Write from the user's perspective using "you" instead of "we" or "one."

| ✓ Preferred | ✗ Avoid |
|-------------|---------|
| You can send transactions using the Lace wallet. | One can send transactions using the Lace wallet. |
| Configure your development environment. | We recommend configuring your development environment.|
| Your proof server handles ZK computation. | Users should configure their development environment. |

## Midnight-specific terminology

### Capitalization standards

**Always capitalize the following terms:**
- **Midnight** (the blockchain network)
- **Testnet** (when referring to the test network)
- **Mainnet** (when referring to the production network)
- **Lace** (the wallet name)
- **DApp** (decentralized application)
- **ZK** (zero-knowledge, when used as abbreviation)

**Use lowercase for the following terms:**
- **tDUST** (testnet tokens - lowercase 't', uppercase 'DUST')
- **proof server** (unless beginning a sentence)
- **smart contract** (unless beginning a sentence)
- **zero-knowledge** (when spelled out, unless beginning a sentence)

### Technical terms

**Midnight-specific terms:**
- **tDUST tokens**: Test tokens on Midnight testnet
- **proof server**: Infrastructure for generating zero-knowledge proofs
- **privacy-preserving**: Preferred over "private" when describing transactions
- **ZK proofs**: Acceptable abbreviation for zero-knowledge proofs

**Consistent terminology:**
- Use "wallet address" not "wallet ID"
- Use "transaction hash" not "transaction ID" 
- Use "smart contract" not "contract" (unless context is clear)
- Use "DApp" not "dApp" or "dapp"

## Content structure standards

### Page organization

- **Clear title** in sentence case
- **Brief introduction** explaining the page's purpose
- **Target audience** (when relevant)
- **Prerequisites** (when applicable)
- **Step-by-step instructions** (for procedures)
- **Next steps** or related content
- **Troubleshooting** (when relevant)

### Heading hierarchy

Use consistent heading structure:

```markdown
# Page title (H1) - only one per page
## Major sections (H2)
### Subsections (H3)
#### Details (H4) - use sparingly
```

**Heading guidelines:**
- Use sentence case
- Be descriptive and scannable
- Include keywords naturally
- Avoid gerunds when possible ("Install tools" vs "Installing tools")

### Prerequisites formatting

Use collapsible details for comprehensive prerequisites:

```markdown
<details>
<summary><strong>System requirements</strong></summary>

**Minimum requirements:**
- RAM: 8GB
- Storage: 10GB free space
- OS: macOS, Linux, or WSL2

</details>
```

## Procedural documentation

### Action starting with verb Step-by-step instructions

Use the `<Step>` and `<Flow>` components for procedures:

```markdown

### Install Lace wallet

Install the Lace wallet extension for Midnight transactions.
(The steps render incrementally)

<Flow>

<Step>
Search for "Lace wallet"
</Step>

<Step>
Click "Add to Chrome"
<Step>

**Verification**: The Lace icon appears in your toolbar.

</Step>
</Flow>
```

### Action verbs

Use specific, action-oriented verbs:

| ✓ Preferred verbs | ✗ Avoid vague verbs |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Click, select, choose | Do, make, get |
| Navigate, go to, visit | Use, utilize, leverage |
| Enter, type, paste | Perform, execute, implement |
| Install, download, configure | |
| Deploy, publish, submit | |

### Error handling

Include common errors and solutions:

```markdown
:::caution Common error
If you see "Connection refused" error, ensure your proof server is running on port 6300.

**Solution**: Restart the proof server with the correct port configuration.
:::
```

## Code documentation standards

### Code blocks

Use proper syntax highlighting and include context:

```markdown
**Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install @midnight/sdk
```

**Configure your environment:**
```javascript
const config = {
  network: 'testnet',
  proofServer: 'http://localhost:6300'
};
```
```

### API documentation

Follow consistent API documentation format:

```markdown
### `sendTransaction()`

Sends a transaction to the Midnight network.

**Parameters:**
- `to` (string): Recipient wallet address
- `amount` (number): Amount in tDUST
- `options` (object, optional): Transaction options

**Returns:** Promise\<TransactionHash\>

**Example:**
```javascript
const hash = await sendTransaction(
  'mn_shield-addr_test1...',
  10.0,
  { privacy: true }
);
```
```

### Variable naming

Use consistent naming in examples:

| ✓ Preferred | Context |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `walletAddress`    | camelCase for JavaScript                |
| `transaction_hash` | snake_case for APIs                     |
| `PROOF_SERVER_URL` | CONSTANT_CASE for environment variables |

## Visual elements

### Admonitions

Use appropriate admonition types:

```markdown

:::tip Helpful hint
Use this for optimization tips and best practices.
:::

:::info Additional information  
Use this for supplementary context and explanations.
:::

:::warning Important notice
Use this for critical information users must know.
:::

:::caution Potential issues
Use this for common pitfalls and error prevention.
:::

:::danger Critical warning
Use this sparingly for serious security or data loss risks.
:::
```

### Tabs for multiple options

Use tabs for alternative approaches:

```markdown
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

Instructions for macOS users.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

Instructions for Linux users.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

### Images and diagrams

**Image guidelines:**
- Use descriptive alt text
- Include captions when helpful
- Optimize for different screen sizes
- Use consistent styling

```markdown
![Lace wallet interface showing balance](/img/lace-wallet-balance.png)
*Figure 1: Lace wallet displaying tDUST balance*
```

## Metadata standards

### Page frontmatter

Use consistent metadata structure:

```yaml
---
title: Page title in sentence case
description: SEO-friendly description, 120-160 characters
sidebar_position: 1
sidebar_label: Short navigation label
tags: [category, topic, lowercase]
slug: /custom-url-path
---
```

### SEO optimization

**Description guidelines:**
- 120-160 characters for optimal SEO
- Include primary keywords naturally
- Write compelling copy that encourages clicks
- Use sentence case

**Keywords:**
- 5-10 relevant terms
- All lowercase
- Include variations and synonyms
- Focus on user intent

## Accessibility standards

### Inclusive language

| ✓ Use inclusive terms | ✗ Avoid |
|-----------------------|---------|
| Allowlist | Whitelist |
| Blocklist | Blacklist |
| Primary/secondary | Master/slave |
| Users | Guys |

### Screen reader compatibility

**Guidelines:**
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include alt text for images
- Use descriptive link text
- Structure content logically

| ✓ Preferred link text | ✗ Avoid |
