This guide provides the essential steps to get you started with Midnight, whether you're here to use privacy-preserving applications or to build them.

## Install the *Lace Midnight Preview* Wallet {#1.-install-the-lace-midnight-preview-wallet}

Lace Midnight Preview Wallet is a browser extension wallet for the Midnight network. It is currently only compatible with Google Chrome.

1. Open the Google Chrome browser.  
2. Install the Lace wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg).  
3. Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm by clicking **Add extension**.  
4. (Recommended) Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access.

**Verification**: The Lace wallet icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar.

### Create Your Wallet {#2.-create-your-wallet}

Your wallet is protected by a seed phrase, which acts as your master key. Keep it secret and safe.

1. Click the Lace wallet icon in your toolbar.  
2. Select **Create a new wallet**.  
3. Choose a strong password.  
4. **Crucially**: Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location. Never store it digitally or share it.  
5. Confirm your seed phrase to complete the setup.

**Verification**: Your wallet dashboard will open, showing a 0 tDUST balance.

### Get Test Tokens (tDUST) {#3.-get-test-tokens-(tdust)}

tDUST is the token used on the Midnight Testnet. It has no real-world value and is used for testing transactions and interacting with applications.

1. In your Lace wallet, click **Receive** and copy your wallet address.  
2. Go to the Testnet Faucet: [https://midnight.network/test-faucet/](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/).  
3. Paste your address into the form and click **Request tDUST**.  
4. Wait a few minutes for the tokens to arrive.

**Verification**: Your Lace wallet will show a new balance of tDUST tokens.

You are now ready to interact with DApps. To start building on Midnight, continue with these additional setup steps for the development environment.

## Set Up the Proof Server {#5.-set-up-the-proof-server}

The Proof Server is required to generate zero-knowledge proofs for transactions locally. It runs as a background service using Docker.

:::note
To use a local proof-server with Lace Midnight Preview wallet, go to **Settings** > **Midnight** and select `Local (http://localhost:6300)
`.
:::

1. **Install Docker Desktop**: If you don't have it, download and install Docker for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux).
   * Get Docker here: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).  

2. **Run the Proof Server**: Start the proof-server in your terminal. It will occupy this terminal window while running. 

```bash
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

**Verification**: The terminal will display logs indicating the server is running and listening at http://localhost:6300.

## Install Compact {#4.-install-compact}

[Compact](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact) is Midnight's dedicated smart contract language for creating applications (dApps) that allow developers to express the amount of data protection that works for them.

1. Install the pre-built binaries using the installer script. Open your terminal and run: 

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/download/compact-v0.2.0/compact-installer.sh | sh
```

2. Your shell will forget about Compact. So, make sure the Compact binary is in your shell's `PATH` to run it from any directory.

3. Verify the installation:

```
compact --version # print version of Compact
which compact # print installation path
```

Your development environment is now configured. You are ready to start building privacy-preserving applications on Midnight.

## Install Compact VS Code Extension 

The Compact VS Code extension has helpful syntax highlight and code snippets. 

1. To install download the VSIX package from the[Compact VS Code extension release page](/relnotes/vs-code-extension)
2. In VS Code go to **Extensions** > **Install from VSIX** > and select the extension file.

**Verification**: You should now see Compact Language Support extension in your installed VS Code extensions.
