Get started with Midnight, whether you are here to use privacy-preserving applications or to build them. The installation process includes setting up the Lace wallet, obtaining test tokens, and configuring the development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Google Chrome browser installed
- Basic familiarity with command-line operations
- Administrative privileges on your computer (for installing Docker and Compact)

## Install the Lace Midnight Preview wallet

### 1. Download and install the Lace wallet extension

Lace Midnight Preview wallet is a browser extension wallet for the Midnight network. It is currently only compatible with Google Chrome.

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>Open the Google Chrome browser.</Step>
    <Step>Install the Lace wallet extension from the Chrome Web Store: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-beta/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg).</Step>
    <Step>Click **Add to Chrome** and confirm by clicking **Add extension**.</Step>
    <Step>Pin the extension to your toolbar for easy access (recommended).</Step>
</StepsProvider>

**Verification**: The Lace wallet icon appears in your Chrome toolbar.

### 2. Create your wallet

Your wallet is protected by a seed phrase, which acts as your master key. Keep it secret and safe.

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>Click the Lace wallet icon in your toolbar.</Step>
    <Step>Select **Create a new wallet**.</Step>
    <Step>Choose a strong password.</Step>
    <Step>**Crucially**: Write down your seed phrase on paper and store it in a secure, offline location. Never store it digitally or share it.</Step>
    <Step>Confirm your seed phrase to complete the setup.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

**Verification**: Your wallet dashboard opens, showing a `0` tDUST balance.

### 3. Get test tokens (tDUST)

tDUST is the token used on the Midnight Testnet. It has no real-world value and is used for testing transactions and interacting with applications.

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>In your Lace wallet, click **Receive** and copy your wallet address.</Step>
    <Step>Go to the Testnet Faucet: [https://midnight.network/test-faucet/](https://midnight.network/test-faucet/).</Step>
    <Step>Paste your address into the form and click **Request tDUST**.</Step>
    <Step>Wait a few minutes for the tokens to arrive.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

**Verification**: Your Lace wallet shows a new balance of tDUST tokens.

You are now ready to interact with DApps. To start building on Midnight, continue with these additional setup steps for the development environment.

## Install Compact

### 4. Install Compact using the installer script

[Compact](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact) is Midnight's dedicated smart contract language for creating applications (DApps) that allow developers to express the amount of data protection that works for them.

Use the following command to install the pre-built binaries:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/download/compact-v0.2.0/compact-installer.sh | sh
```

### 5. Update your shell PATH

Make sure the Compact binary is in your shell's `PATH` to run it from any directory. Your shell needs to be updated after installation.

### 6. Verify the Compact installation

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>Run `compact --version` to print version of Compact.</Step>
    <Step>Run `which compact` to print installation path.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

```bash
compact --version # print version of Compact
which compact     # print installation path
```

**Verification**: These commands return the Compact version number and installation path.

## Set up the proof server

### 7. Install Docker Desktop

The proof server is required to generate zero-knowledge proofs for transactions locally. It runs as a background service using Docker.

If you don't have Docker, download and install Docker for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux):
- Get Docker here: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 8. Run the proof server

Use the following command to start the proof-server in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server -- 'midnight-proof-server --network testnet'
```

This command occupies the terminal window while running.

**Verification**: The terminal displays logs indicating the server is running and listening at http://localhost:6300.

:::note
To use a local proof-server with Lace Midnight Preview wallet, go to **Settings** > **Midnight** and select `Local (http://localhost:6300)`.

## Install Compact VS Code extension

### 9. Download the Compact VS Code extension

The Compact VS Code extension provides helpful syntax highlighting and code snippets.

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>Download the VSIX package from the [Compact VS Code extension release page](/relnotes/vs-code-extension).</Step>
    <Step>In VS Code go to **Extensions**, then **Install from VSIX** and select the extension file.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

**Verification**: You now see Compact Language Support extension in your installed VS Code extensions.

Your development environment is now configured. You are ready to start building privacy-preserving applications on Midnight.
