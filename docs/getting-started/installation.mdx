This guide covers the installation of core dependencies for developing decentralized applications (DApps) on Midnight. For users intending to interact with DApps on Midnight testnets, see the [Set up Lace Wallet](../guides/lace-wallet) guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin developing DApps on Midnight, ensure you have:

- Google Chrome browser
- Docker Desktop: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- Lace Midnight Preview Wallet: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-midnight-preview/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lace-midnight-preview/hgeekaiplokcnmakghbdfbgnlfheichg)

## Install Compact

[Compact](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact) is Midnight's dedicated smart contract language for creating DApps that allows developers to control the level of data protection in their applications.

Use the following command to install the pre-built binaries:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
```

### Update your shell PATH

The installer script automatically adds Compact to your shell's `PATH`. However, you need to restart your terminal or reload your shell configuration for the changes to take effect.

To reload your shell configuration without restarting, run the following command:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc # for zsh
# or
source ~/.bashrc # for bash
```

**Manual PATH configuration** (only if needed): If Compact is not found after restarting, manually add it to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.compact/bin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell configuration as shown above.

### Update the compiler version

Update to the latest compiler version:

```bash
compact update
```

This command downloads the latest version of the Compact compiler and sets it as the default version.

### Verify the Compact installation

Run these commands to verify your installation:

```bash
compact --version # print the version of Compact
compact compile --version # print the version of the compiler
which compact     # print the installation path
```

**Verification**: These commands return the Compact version number, the compiler version number, and the installation path.

## Set up the proof server

The proof server is required to generate zero-knowledge proofs for transactions locally. This section walks you through the process of running the proof server.

### Docker Desktop

The proof server runs as a background service using Docker. Ensure the Docker engine is running for the following step.

### Run the proof server

Use the following command to start the proof server in your terminal:

```bash
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:7.0.0 -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

This command occupies the terminal window while running.

**Verification**: The terminal displays logs indicating the server is running and listening at http://localhost:6300.

:::note
To use a local proof-server with Lace Midnight Preview wallet, go to **Settings » Midnight** and select `Local (http://localhost:6300)`.

## Install the Compact VS Code extension

The Compact VS Code extension provides helpful syntax highlighting and code snippet completion. To install it, follow these steps:

<StepsProvider>
    <Step>Download the [VSIX package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midnight-ntwrk/releases/gh-pages/artifacts/vscode-extension/compact-0.2.13/compact-0.2.13.vsix).</Step>
    <Step>In VS Code, go to **Extensions**, then **Install from VSIX** and select the extension file.</Step>
</StepsProvider>

**Verification**: You now see the Compact Language Support extension in your installed VS Code extensions.

## Install Complete

Your development environment is now configured. You are ready to start building and interacting with privacy-preserving applications on Midnight.

## Troubleshoot

This section covers common issues that you might encounter during installation and their solutions.

### Compact binary not found

If you see this error:

```bash
compact: command not found
```

This means the Compact binary is not in your `PATH`. Follow the instructions in [Update your shell PATH](#update-your-shell-path) to add it to your `PATH`.

### Docker Desktop not running

If you encounter connection errors when starting the proof server, ensure Docker Desktop is running:

1. Open Docker Desktop application.
2. Wait for the Docker engine to start (the Docker icon in your system tray should be steady, not animated).
3. Try running the proof server command again.

### Port already in use

If you see an error that port 6300 is already in use:

```bash
Error: bind: address already in use
```

Either stop the process using port 6300, or run the proof server on a different port:

```bash
docker run -p 6301:6300 midnightntwrk/proof-server:7.0.0 -- midnight-proof-server -v
```

Remember to update your application configuration to use the new port.

## Next steps

Now that your development environment is set up, you can:

- [Create your first Midnight DApp](./hello-world)
- [Explore the Compact language](../compact/)
