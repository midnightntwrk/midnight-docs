# Create a Midnight Network app

A Midnight Network (MN) app is a privacy-preserving DApp that uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to maintain data confidentiality. The core value proposition is selective disclosure, which allows users to prove specific information while keeping other sensitive data private.

## Prerequisites

The following software and tools are required:

* **Node.js**: Version 20.x or higher. Install Node.js using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
  ```bash
  nvm install 20
  ```
* **Command-line knowledge**: Basic familiarity with terminal operations.
* **Code editor**: An IDE such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Create a project

<StepsProvider>
<Step>

**Initialize the project.** Create a project folder, navigate to the folder, and initialize an npm project. The `-y` flag accepts all default settings.

```bash
mkdir my-mn-app
cd my-mn-app
npm init -y
```

</Step>
<Step>

**Create the required directories.** The project requires separate folders for smart contracts and application source code.

```bash
mkdir src contracts
```

The project structure now appears as follows:

```bash
my-mn-app/
├── contracts/
├── src/
└── package.json
```

</Step>
<Step>

**Create the contract file.** Create a file named `hello-world.compact` in the contracts directory.

```bash
touch contracts/hello-world.compact
```

</Step>
</StepsProvider>

## Add the pragma version directive

Every Compact smart contract begins with a `pragma` directive. This directive declares the compiler version with which the contract is compatible, ensuring predictable behavior and preventing issues with future compiler updates. A fixed version (`pragma language_version = 0.16;`) or a compatible range can be specified. A range provides flexibility by allowing minor updates and bug fixes.

<StepsProvider>
<Step number="4">

**Add the pragma directive.** Add the following line to the top of `contracts/hello-world.compact`. This directive allows versions from `0.16` through `0.17`.

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.16 && <= 0.17;
```

</Step>
</StepsProvider>

## Import the Compact Standard Library

An `import` statement for the Compact Standard Library is required to access built-in types and functions that are essential for contract development.

<StepsProvider>
<Step number="5">

**Add the import statement.** Add the import statement on the next line of the contract.

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.16 && <= 0.17;

import CompactStandardLibrary;
```

</Step>
</StepsProvider>

## Define the ledger declaration

The `ledger` section defines the on-chain state variables for a contract. This section functions as a schema for data stored permanently on the blockchain. Variables can be marked with `export` to make them accessible from a dApp.

**Syntax:**

```compact
ledger <identifier>: <type>;
export ledger <identifier>: <type>;
```

This contract uses the `Opaque<"string">` type, which stores variable-length strings while preserving privacy.

<StepsProvider>
<Step number="6">

**Create the ledger declaration.** This line reserves on-chain storage for a string variable named `message`.

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.16 && <= 0.17;

import CompactStandardLibrary;

export ledger message: Opaque<"string">;
```

</Step>
</StepsProvider>

## Define the circuit

Circuits are the functions of a Compact smart contract and are compiled directly into a zero-knowledge circuit. Circuits can accept parameters, perform computations, and modify the contract state. Circuits marked with `export` can be called from external applications.

**Syntax:**

```compact
circuit <function>([parameters]): [return_type] { logic }
export circuit <function>([parameters]): [return_type] { logic }
```

<StepsProvider>
<Step number="7">

**Define the storeMessage circuit.** This circuit accepts a custom message as input and stores the message in the `message` state variable.

```compact
export circuit storeMessage(customMessage: Opaque<"string">): [] {
    message = disclose(customMessage);
}
```

:::info Why disclose() is required
Compact enforces privacy by default. All user input is considered private unless explicitly made public. The `disclose()` function indicates that the message is intentionally visible on the public ledger.
:::

</Step>
</StepsProvider>

The complete `hello-world.compact` contract appears as follows:

```compact
pragma language_version >= 0.16 && <= 0.17;

import CompactStandardLibrary;

export ledger message: Opaque<"string">;

export circuit storeMessage(customMessage: Opaque<"string">): [] {
    message = disclose(customMessage);
}
```

## Compile the smart contract

Compiling a Compact contract transforms the high-level logic into zero-knowledge circuits, generates cryptographic keys, and creates TypeScript APIs for the dApp frontend. This process enforces Midnight's privacy and security guarantees.

<StepsProvider>
<Step number="8">

**Compile the contract.** Run the following command from the project root directory.

```bash
compact compile contracts/hello-world.compact contracts/managed/hello-world
```

This command generates the necessary artifacts in the `contracts/managed/hello-world` directory. The generated structure appears as follows:

```
contracts/
└── managed
    └── hello-world
        ├── compiler
        ├── contract
        ├── keys
        └── zkir
```

* `contract/`: Contains the compiled contract artifacts, including JSON files required for deployment and frontend integration.
* `keys/`: Stores the cryptographic proving and verifying keys for the zero-knowledge proofs.
* `zkir/`: Contains the Zero-Knowledge Intermediate Representation of the circuit, which bridges the Compact code to the ZK backend.
* `compiler/`: Holds intermediate files used by the compiler during the build process.
