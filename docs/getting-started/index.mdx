# Get started

Midnight is a <GlossaryTerm term="blockchain" /> platform for building privacy-preserving <GlossaryTerm term="DApps" />. It enables developers to define how data is isolated, verified, and shared through <GlossaryTerm term="zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs" /> and programmable confidentiality controls.

Use this quickstart workflow to set up your local environment and deploy your first application on the Midnight network. You’ll install the toolchain, create and configure a Midnight app, deploy your <GlossaryTerm term="smart contract" /> and service, and learn how to interact with your deployed components.

When you complete this workflow, you’ll have a fully functioning Midnight app running on local Devnet and a clear understanding of how to develop, test, and iterate on privacy-enabled contracts.
