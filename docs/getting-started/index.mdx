# Get started

Midnight is a <GlossaryTerm term="blockchain" /> platform for building privacy-preserving <GlossaryTerm term="DApps" />. It enables developers to define how data is isolated, verified, and shared through <GlossaryTerm term="zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs" /> and programmable confidentiality controls.

Use this quickstart workflow to set up your local environment and deploy your first application on the Midnight network. You’ll install the toolchain, create and configure a Midnight app, deploy your <GlossaryTerm term="smart contract" /> and service, and learn how to interact with your deployed components.

Each section of this getting started is designed to build upon the previous one, introducing the Midnight toolchain, network environment, and developer lifecycle.  

When you complete this workflow, you’ll have a fully functioning Midnight app running on <GlossaryTerm term="testnet" /> and a clear understanding of how to develop, test, and iterate on privacy-enabled contracts.
