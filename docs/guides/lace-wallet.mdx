# Lace wallet

The Lace wallet is a Chrome extension. This guide is aimed at Testnet DApp users who are setting up the Lace wallet for the first time.

:::important Chrome browser

You must use the Chrome web browser or its derivatives to complete
web-based transactions on the Midnight testnet.

Only the Chrome browser itself is fully supported. The Lace
wallet may not be able to connect to your local proof server from
Chrome derivatives. If you choose to use Brave, for example, it is
necessary to disable Brave shields when running the Hello World DApp, so that the DApp (hosted at one address) can contact
your local proof server (hosted on your system, at a different
address) through the Lace extension.
