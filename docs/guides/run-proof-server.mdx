# Proof server

Midnight uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable shielded
transactions and data protection. An essential element of this
architecture is ZK functionality provided by a Midnight *proof
server*, which generates proofs locally that are verified on-chain. 

The information that a DApp sends to the proof server includes
private data, such as details of token ownership or a DApp's
private state. To protect your data, you should access only a local
proof server, or perhaps one on a remote machine that you control,
over an encrypted channel.

This guide shows you how to run the proof server locally in order
to process transactions on the Midnight Network. The wallet communicates with the proof
server to invoke ZK functionality and generate ZK proofs for your
transactions.

This guide is aimed at Midnight Network users, rather than DApp Builders.

## Install Docker Desktop 

If you don't have Docker, then download and install Docker for your operating system (macOS, Windows, or Linux):
https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

New users might need to set up an account.

## Install the proof server

Docker hosts completed code in Images. The Midnight proof server is available as a Docker Image.

1. Inside Docker Desktop, use the search bar to locate `midnightntwrk/proof-server:7.0.0`.
2. Pull the image.

After pulling the image, the code for the proof server is hosted in a Container in Docker Desktop.

## Start the proof server

Start the proof server by clicking **Run** button in the same search result, or by navigating to your
Containers and clicking the **Run** button there.

To inspect the proof server, navigate to Containers and **View Details** -- there is no action required here,
but you should see some output indicating that the server has started.

The proof server listens on port 6300 and *this should not be changed*.

## Stop the proof server

To stop the proof server, simply stop the container.

For processing transactions on the Midnight network, the proof server must be
running, so if you have stopped it, start it again now.

## Your privacy

The proof server exists to protect your privacy.  It does not open any
network connections; it simply listens on its assigned port for
requests from your wallet.
