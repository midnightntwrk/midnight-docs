# Proof server

:::warning Disclaimer
The Midnight Preview network is unstable and may experience downtime. Preview-related guides are intended for experienced developers.
:::

Midnight uses zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to enable shielded
transactions and data protection. An essential element of this
architecture is ZK functionality provided by a Midnight *proof
server*, which generates proofs locally that will be verified on-chain. 

The information that a DApp sends to the proof server includes
private data, such as details of token ownership or a DApp's
private state. To protect your data, you should access only a local
proof server, or perhaps one on a remote machine that you control,
over an encrypted channel.

Run a Midnight proof server on your system in a Docker container. 
The Lace Midnight Preview wallet communicates with the proof
server to invoke ZK functionality and generate ZK proofs for your transactions.

## Install the proof server

1. In the prerequisites from the installation guide, you
installed Docker and verified your access to the [Midnight Docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/u/midnightnetwork).

   - Using the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker search midnightnetwork
      ```

   - Or by searching `midnightnetwork` in the Docker Desktop search bar.

2. To download the Docker image for the Midnight proof server:

   - Via the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker pull midnightnetwork/proof-server:latest
      ```

      If you need to run an older version of the proof-server, Replace `latest` with the required version of the proof server according to the [release compatibility matrix](../../../relnotes/support-matrix).

   - Or by clicking **pull** in the search results of the Docker Desktop.


3. You can verify the download's success by checking that the following
command lists a proof server image.

   - Via the terminal:

      ```shell
      docker images | grep proof-server
      ```
    
   - Or by clicking **>_ Terminal**, clicking **Enable Docker terminal** and running the same command as above.


## Start the proof server

In the terminal, run the proof server with the following command:

```shell
docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server:6.1.0-alpha.6 -- midnight-proof-server --network preview
```

You should see some output indicating that the server has started.

## Stop the proof server

To stop the proof server, simply exit the process you launched with
`docker run`. For example, on most systems, you can type `Ctrl-C` to
stop the process.

**For the next step in this tutorial, the proof server must be
running**, so if you have stopped it, start it again now.

## Your privacy

The proof server exists to protect your privacy.  It does not open any
network connections; it simply listens on its assigned port for
requests from your Chrome extension. One of the lines of output you
may see from the proof server includes this text:

```
Targeting network: Preview
```

This indicates that the instance you are running is configured
appropriately to generate proofs that are valid on the Midnight
Preview. It does not indicate a network connection from the proof
server to Preview.

Please let the DevRel support team know if you have any privacy
concerns regarding the proof server.

## Set up proof server as a systemd service

Optionally for Linux users, you might consider running the proof server as an automatic background process anytime you boot your machine.

1. Create a new file for your systemd service, typically in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory. For example:

```shell
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/midnight-proof-server.service
```

2. Add the following contents.

```
[Unit]
Description=Midnight Network Proof Server
After=docker.service
Requires=docker.service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/docker run -p 6300:6300 midnightnetwork/proof-server:6.1.0-alpha.6 -- midnight-proof-server --network preview
Restart=always
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Adjust the `Description`, `ExecStart`, and other parameters as needed.

3. Reload systemd manager to apply changes.

```shell
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. **Start** service.
```
sudo systemctl start midnight-proof-server # start service
```

5. How to **stop** and get **status** of service.

```shell
sudo systemctl enable midnight-proof-server # stop service

sudo systemctl status midnight-proof-server # get status of service
```
