## Midnight 4.0.0 Onchain Runtime Release Notes

Learn about the latest updates and improvements to the Midnight Onchain Runtime, including new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes designed to enhance functionality and stability.

### Stable Release

* **Version**: 4.0.0
* **Audience**: Developers integrating with the Midnight ecosystem
* **Environment**: Production-ready

This release (version `4.0.0`) is considered stable and production-ready. It can safely be deployed in public and production environments.

### Changelog

#### Breaking

- Integrated with the new storage model, making required objects `Storable` to allow storing MPT leafs as `Sp`s.
- Added segment IDs to Zswap constructors. These should be set to `1` for fallible offers, and `0` for guaranteed offers.
- Renamed `ZswapLocalStateNoKeys` to `ZswapLocalState`, removing the existing (with keys) state.
- Switch from Pluto-Eris to BLS12-381.
- Switched to using data providers instead of direct prover keys and parameters.

#### Features

- Add a data provider to fetch key material for Midnight. The source of this may be overridden with the `MIDNIGHT_PARAM_SOURCE` environment variable.
