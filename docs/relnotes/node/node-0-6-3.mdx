- Added support for multiple ledger versions.
- Added inherent transactions for runtime versioning and upgraded chain specs.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed issues with outdated `inputoutput` image references.
- Resolved synchronization issues in the transaction generator for non-local nodes.
- Addressed chain spec issues.
- Fixed generator Docker builds to work with WSS RPC and improved sync speeds.
- Resolved issues with `cargo.lock` and dependency mismatches.
