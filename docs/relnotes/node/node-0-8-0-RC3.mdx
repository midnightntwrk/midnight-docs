## Midnight 0.8.0 RC3 release notes

This pre-release introduces key updates to enhance metrics, improve key derivation methods, and incorporate additional configurations for testnet environments.



### New Features

- Integrated Prometheus metrics for the ledger to enable real-time monitoring.
- Added comprehensive benchmarks for `midnight-pallet` to assess performance.
- Included governance keys for `qanet` in the `res` directory for streamlined management.
- Introduced a tool to automate release notes creation.
- Added `testnet-02` configurations to the node for improved testing support.

### Changes

- Ledger upgraded to 3.0.5 and further upgraded to 3.0.6.
- Transaction generator has a resolved issue with `generate-contract-calls` by ensuring a random nonce is used by default.
- Implemented new and legacy key derivation methods across all networks, except for testnet.
- Updated to use new key derivation for funding wallets in `qanet` and `local` genesis files.
- Rust compiler upgraded from version 1.82 to 1.83.
- Set the default trie cache size to zero.
- Adjusted the default shutdown behavior to trigger at 512 MB of remaining storage instead of 1024 MB.
- Refactored the transaction generator to use thread-local global for network ID serialization/deserialization.


### Known Issues

- Further validation of benchmarks under high-load scenarios is pending.  

### Upgrade Instructions

1. Deploy the node image specified in this release.  
2. Ensure compatibility with Ledger 3.0.6.  
3. Verify and apply the new `testnet-02` configurations.  
4. Align genesis files with the new and legacy key derivation methods where applicable.
