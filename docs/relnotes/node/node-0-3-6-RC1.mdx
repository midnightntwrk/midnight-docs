## Midnight 0.3.6 RC1 release notes

The Midnight node release for the existing qa-net/devnet environments (environments whose ledgers are based solely on the Plonk-based proving system).

### New Features

- Lowered the transaction limit to test the devnet environment.
- Made the `seed` argument optional.
- Backported the transaction generator to the Plonk branch.
- Added a storage monitor to the Plonk branch.
- Introduced the ability to override the `d` parameter and committee mode.
- Created a runtime WASM containing the `d` parameter override.
- Updated `qanet` chain specs and `addresses.json`.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the Docker build for the transaction generator, ensuring compatibility with WSS RPC.
- Addressed issues with the `seed` parameter in boot nodes.
- Updated the `cargo.lock` file.
- Fixed and enabled all E2E tests.

### Breaking Changes

- Updated to **Node 0.3.6**, requiring compatibility adjustments for environments using older versions.
- Bumped spec version to `0.2.3` with the new `d` parameter override.

### Known Issues

- Minor inconsistencies may occur when testing the lowered transaction limits in custom environments.
- Further optimizations may be required for the storage monitor in high-load scenarios.

### Upgrade Instructions

1. Update the node to version **0.3.6** by pulling the latest changes.
2. Adjust your configurations to accommodate the optional `seed` argument.
3. Test the new transaction limits on your devnet environment to ensure compatibility.
