### Stable Release

* **Environment**: Production-ready

This release (0.12.1) is considered stable and production-ready. It can safely be deployed in public and production environments.

### Key Changes & Highlights

This release is backwards compatible with 0.12.0 — no chain reset required.
:::

* New **chain-spec** for devnet and testnet-02 deployment.
* Deprecated config env-vars (`NODE_KEY`, `SEED_PHRASE`) — use mounted secrets instead.

### Changelog

- Rename chain spec files.
- Fix midnight-docs to refer to `tree` command.
