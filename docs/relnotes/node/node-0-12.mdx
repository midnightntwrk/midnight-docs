## Midnight Node 0.12.0 Release Notes

### Stable Release

* **Version**: 0.12.0
* **Audience**: Node operators, developers integrating with the Midnight ecosystem
* **Environment**: Production-ready

This release (0.12.0) is considered stable and production-ready. It can safely be deployed in public and production environments.

This release includes PC1.5 and BLS support and uses the new storage model.

### Key Changes & Highlights

:::note
This change requires a chain-reset for our production environment (testnet-02)
:::

* Switch field/curves from Pluto-Eris to BLS12-381
  - Why: smaller and faster proofs. 10x smaller public params (500Mb->50Mb).

* Switch to new storage model
  - Faster performance no longer tied to size of ledger state

* PC1.5
