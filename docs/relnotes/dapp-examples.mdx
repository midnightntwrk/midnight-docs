# Midnight Example Applications

The Midnight example applications showcase different use cases and smart contract functionalities.

- Bulletin Board DApp (`bboard`) – A simple one-item bulletin board where users can post and remove messages. A tutorial version (`bboard-tutorial`) is included, guiding developers through implementing missing components before reviewing the completed solution.
- Counter DApp (`counter`) – A smart contract that maintains a publicly stored counter, allowing users to increment its value. This example covers contract development, testing, and deployment using Midnight’s tooling.
