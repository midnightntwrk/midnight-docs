# Ledger

The ledger in Midnight is a public record of contract states and token states, consisting of Zswapâ€™s cryptographic commitments and a mapping of contract addresses to their respective states.

## Midnight 3.0.6 Ledger release notes

Learn about the latest updates and improvements to the Midnight Ledger, including new features, bug fixes, and breaking changes designed to enhance functionality and stability.

## New Features

- Introduced `coinCommitment` and `coinNullifier` functions.
- Introduced API separating keys from Zswap local state to Zswap packages.
- Catch breaking change in `midnight-storage-0.3`, where the serialization shape of `Map` changed. This required minor version bumps on all types with nested `Map` structures.

## Breaking Changes

- Some data structures are no longer directly constructable due to added private fields:
  - `Transaction` is no longer a public structured enum. Its components have been extracted into `StandardTransaction` and `ClaimMintTransaction`, which are now private.
  - `ContractCall`, `ContractDeploy`, and `MaintenanceUpdate` are now private.
  - Use the `transaction-construction` feature and its methods to construct transactions.
- Changes in `midnight-storage-0.3` affected serialization, requiring updates for types with nested `Map` structures.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed a security bug in Schnorr proofs using incorrect information in in-memory environments.
- Removed various instances of triggerable panics in the ledger.
- Removed vulnerability in balance checking (breaking change for a minority of transactions).
- Fixed Schnorr proofs not surviving serialization.
- Fixed a security-related issue with Schnorr proofs in in-memory environments.
- Fixed transaction re-serialization issues.
- Fixed WASM `checkProofData` endpoint.
- Fixed WASM API `fees` endpoint.
- Fixed maintenance update Schnorr proofs not persisting after serialization.
- Fixed debug logging removal from the proof server.
