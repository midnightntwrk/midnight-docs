## High-level summary

The Midnight Faucet is a token distribution service for the Midnight Network testnet environments. It enables developers
and testers to request test tokens for their wallets, supporting both web-based and programmatic access.

---

## Audience

This release is relevant for:

- Developers building and testing DApps on the Midnight Network
- Testers who need test tokens for Preprod or Preview environments
- Teams integrating Faucet functionality into their testing pipelines
- Operators deploying Faucet infrastructure

---

## New features

Below are the new features introduced in this release:

### Faucet server

HTTP server that handles token distribution requests. Manages rate limiting, CAPTCHA verification, 
and asynchronous task processing for token transfers. Exposes REST API endpoints for token requests and status polling.

### Faucet UI

React-based web interface for requesting test tokens. Integrates Cloudflare Turnstile for CAPTCHA protection and provides real-time status updates for token requests.

### Faucet client

TypeScript client library for programmatic faucet access. Enables automated testing workflows and
integration with CI/CD pipelines.

**Example**:

```typescript
import { FaucetClient } from "@midnight-ntwrk/faucet-client";

const client = FaucetClient("http://localhost:5300/api");
const authToken = await client.login("<username>", "<password>");
const initialized = client.init(authToken);
const { transactionIdentifier } = initialized.requestTokens("<my wallet address>");
```

---

### Rate limiting

Daily request limits per wallet address to ensure fair distribution of test tokens. Automatically
resets at the start of each day (UTC).

---

### CAPTCHA protection

Cloudflare Turnstile integration to prevent automated abuse of the faucet service.

---

### Task queue

Asynchronous task processing system for handling token distribution requests. Supports polling-based
status updates and error recovery.

---

### Metrics and monitoring

Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint for monitoring faucet health, request rates, and system
performance.

---

## New features requiring configuration updates

Here are the new features requiring configuration updates:

### Database connection

The faucet requires PostgreSQL for persisting rate limits, task state, and request history.

**Required updates**:
- Configure PostgreSQL connection string
- Run database migrations

### Node endpoint

Required for submitting token transfer transactions to the network.

**Required updates**: Configure Midnight Node WebSocket endpoint.

### Indexer endpoint

Required for wallet synchronization and balance verification.

**Required updates**: Configure Midnight Indexer GraphQL endpoint.

### CAPTCHA configuration

CAPTCHA verification will fail without valid Turnstile credentials.

**Required updates**:
- Configure Cloudflare Turnstile site key (UI).
- Configure Cloudflare Turnstile secret key (Server).

## Breaking changes

No breaking changes for this release.

---

## Known issues

**Issue**: Rate limit may not immediately reset at midnight UTC.

**Description**: Due to caching, the rate limit reset may be delayed by a few minutes after midnight UTC.

**Workaround**: Wait a few minutes after midnight or restart the server to clear the cache.
