# Compact toolchain

Compact is Midnight's smart contract programming language, designed for building secure, efficient, and adaptable decentralized applications.

The Compact toolchain includes the Compact compiler, formatter, and the Compact "fixup" tool.
The compiler translates Compact smart contract code into JavaScript implementations and a representation of the zero-knowledge circuits.

[Link to related documentation](../compact/compilation-and-tooling/compiler-usage)

To install the toolchain, first install the [compact devtools](compact-tools.mdx) and then use `compact update` (for the latest version) or `compact update 0.28.0` (for a specific version, such as 0.28.0 in this case).
