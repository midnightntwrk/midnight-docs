# Compact.js

Compact.js provides a TypeScript-based execution environment for smart contracts compiled with the Compact compiler.
When a Compact smart contract is compiled, the output includes 
a JavaScript file and a TypeScript declaration file. 

Compact.js uses these files at runtime to execute the circuits. 
The circuit execution results are then used by higher-level tools and frameworks (such as Midnight.js) to create and submit transactions to the Midnight blockchain.

For more information, see the [Compact language documentation](../compact).
