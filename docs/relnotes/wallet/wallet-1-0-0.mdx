* **Version**: v1.0.0 
* **Date**: 28 January, 2026 
* **Environment**: preprod, preview

---

## High-level summary

This is the initial stable release of the Midnight Wallet SDK, a TypeScript wallet implementation for the Midnight
Network. It provides complete support for Midnight's three-token system: unshielded tokens (including NIGHT), shielded tokens with
zero-knowledge proofs, and DUST for fee payments.

---

## Audience

This release is relevant for developers who:

- Implement wallet functionality on the Midnight Network
- Integrate Midnight token transfers into their DApps
- Need to manage shielded (private) and unshielded token balances
- Implement atomic swaps between parties

---

## What changed (Summary of updates)

- Full support for unshielded tokens (including NIGHT)
- Full support for shielded tokens with zero-knowledge proofs
- Dust management for transaction fee payments
- HD wallet key derivation
- Bech32m address encoding and decoding
- Transaction balancing across all token types
- Atomic swap support

---

## New features
Below is a detailed breakdown of the new features added in this release.

### Wallet facade

Unified API that enables shielded, unshielded, and dust wallet operations through a single interface.
It handles transaction balancing, transfers, and swaps. This is the main entry point for most developers, abstracting the
complexity of managing three separate wallet types.

### Unshielded wallet

Manages NIGHT and other unshielded tokens using a UTxO model with Schnorr signatures. Tracks UTxOs,
creates offers for swaps, and provides inputs/outputs for transaction balancing. Use this for transparent token
operations.

### Shielded wallet

Manages privacy-preserving shielded tokens using Zswap zero-knowledge proofs. Handles ZK proof
generation, coin commitment tracking, and encrypted output decryption. Token values and addresses are hidden from
observers while maintaining verifiability.

### DUST wallet

Manages Dust, the fee payment resource generated from NIGHT holdings. Handles Dust address designation,
balance tracking, and automatic fee payment during transaction balancing. Required for submitting any transaction on the
network.

### HD wallet

Derives cryptographic keys from a seed following BIP-32/BIP-44/CIP-1852 standards. Generates keys for
unshielded (secp256k1), shielded (JubJub curve), and Dust (BLS12-381 curve) operations from a single mnemonic or seed.

### Address format

Encodes and decodes Midnight addresses using Bech32m format. Supports three address types with network
identifiers:

- `mn_addr` - Unshielded payment addresses
- `mn_shield-addr` - Shielded payment addresses
- `mn_dust-addr` - Dust addresses for fee generation

### Transaction balancing

Automatically provides inputs to cover outputs, creates change outputs for surplus, and adds Dust
spends for fees. Works across all token types in a single transaction. This is the core operation that enables
transfers, contract interactions, and swaps.

### Atomic swaps

Enables trustless token exchanges between parties using Midnight's offer system. Offers can be merged
into a single transaction that hides the exchanged amounts from observers. Currently supports shielded-only or
unshielded-only swaps.

---

## New features requiring configuration updates

The following updates are required to configure the wallet to use the new features.

### Prover service connection

Zero-knowledge proofs for shielded transactions and Dust spends require an external prover service. The
wallet cannot submit shielded transactions without this configuration.

**Required updates**:
- Configure prove server endpoint URL.
- Ensure the prove server is running and accessible via the configured endpoint URL.

### Node endpoint

The wallet requires a connection to a Midnight Node to submit transactions and query blockchain state.

**Required updates**:
- Configure Midnight Node WebSocket endpoint.
- Ensure the Midnight Node is running and accessible.

### Indexer endpoint

The wallet requires a connection to the indexer to synchronize UTxOs, transaction history, and state data.

**Required updates**:
- Configure indexer GraphQL endpoint.
- Ensure the indexer is running and accessible.

---

## Known issues

This section lists the known issues with this release of the wallet SDK.

### Pending coins not cleared on transaction failure

When transaction submission or proof generation fails, coins marked as pending are not automatically
released. This can cause the wallet to report lower available balances until the pending state is manually cleared or
the wallet is restarted.

**Workaround**: Restart the wallet or re-sync to clear the stale pending state.

### Transaction history not implemented for shielded and dust wallets

The shielded and dust wallets do not currently track transaction history. While the unshielded wallet
maintains transaction records, the shielded and dust wallets only track coin balances without historical transaction
data.
