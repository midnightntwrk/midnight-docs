## Compact developer tools 0.4.0 release notes

Today we are releasing the Compact developer tools (devtools) 0.4.0.
This release improves the `compact fixup` command with a simplified interface and a new check mode for CI workflows.

If you have an existing devtools installation, you can update it with the command `compact self update`.

If you do not have an existing devtools installation, you can install version 0.4.0 using the shell command shown on [the release page](https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/tag/compact-v0.4.0).

## Breaking Changes

### The `compact fixup` command now operates in-place by default

Previously, `compact fixup` would output fixed code to stdout by default, and you needed to pass `--in-place` or `-i` to modify files directly.
In version 0.4.0, the command modifies files in-place by default, and the `--in-place` flag has been removed.

If you have scripts that relied on the stdout behavior, you should update them to use the new `--check` flag, which outputs diffs without modifying files.

## New Features

### Check mode for `compact fixup`

The new `--check` (or `-c`) flag allows you to verify whether files need fixup without actually modifying them.
This is useful for CI pipelines or pre-commit hooks where you want to fail the build if contracts are not properly fixed up.

```
compact fixup --check .
```

When changes are needed, the command will:
- Print a diff showing what would be changed
- Exit with a non-zero status code

When no changes are needed, the command exits successfully with no output.

### Simplified directory processing

You can now run `compact fixup` on directories without any special flags:

```
compact fixup .
```

This will process all `.compact` files in the directory (excluding those matched by `.gitignore`), fixing them up in place.

### Version information from the underlying tools

The `--version` (`-V`) and new `--language-version` flags for both `compact fixup` and `compact format` now report version information from the underlying toolchain tools (`fixup-compact` and `format-compact`) rather than the devtools version.

This makes it easier to verify which language version your tools support:

```
compact fixup --language-version
compact format --language-version
```

## Bug Fixes

### Improved error message for missing formatter

When the formatter is not available, the error message now provides clearer guidance:

```
Error: formatter not available - please install a compiler version that includes format-compact
```
