## Compact developer tools 0.1.0 release notes

Today we are releasing the initial version of the Compact developer tools.
This release is version 0.1.0 of the developer tools.
It supports working with Compact toolchains (i.e., the compiler) version 0.22, 0.23, and 0.24.

## Initial Features

This is the initial version of the developer tooling.
A detailed explanation of how to use the tooling is described in the
[announcement blog post](https://docs.midnight.network/blog/compact-developer-tools).

The tools are available by invoking subcommands of the `compact` command-line tool.
The following subcommands are available:

- `help` will provide detailed help on the tool and on the subcommands
- `check` will check a remote server for toolchain updates
- `update` will update to the latest or a specific version, downloading it if necessary
- `list` will list available versions, either on the remote server or installed locally
- `clean` will remove downloaded toolchain artifacts, with an option to keep the current default toolchain
- `compile` will use the default toolchain or a specific one to compile a Compact contract
- `self check` will check for updates to the developer tools themselves
- `self update` will update to the latest version of the developer tools

All of the tools have detailed builtin help pages.
