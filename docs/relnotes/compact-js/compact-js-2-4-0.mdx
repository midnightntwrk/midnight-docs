## High-level summary 

Compact.js provides a TypeScript-based execution environment for smart contracts
compiled with the [Compact](../../compact) language. This release
is the initial release of Compact.js and is used internally by Midnight.js and the Node Toolkit.

Compact.js provides a core library for tool and framework developers, as well as a _command_ package that encapsulates the
library-provided capabilities as commands that can be integrated into command-line applications built with
[Effect's CLI](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/docs/cli).

---

## Audience

This release is relevant for developers who build tools or frameworks that deploy and interact with contracts on the Midnight blockchain.

---

## New features

Here are the new features in this release:

### Core library

`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js` provides the core capabilities to build `CompiledContract`
instances from the compiled assets produced by the Compact compiler. These can then be transformed 
into `ContractExecutable` instances, which are used to initialize and run contract instances.

### Commanding

`@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js-command` provides commands that consume a TypeScript-based configuration
defining a `CompiledContract` and expose it via a command-line interface.

## Important notes

While developers can use Compact.js to interact with Compact-compiled contracts at runtime, 
this release is primarily intended for internal use by the Midnight.js contracts package 
(`@midnight-ntwrk/midnight-js-contracts`) to deploy contracts and invoke their circuits. 

DApp developers are encouraged to continue using Midnight.js for these capabilities.
