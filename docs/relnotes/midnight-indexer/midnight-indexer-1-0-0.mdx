# Midnight Indexer

The Midnight Indexer is a set of components designed to optimize the flow of blockchain data from a Midnight node to end-user applications. It retrieves history of blocks, processes them, stores indexed data efficiently, and provides a GraphQL API for queries and subscriptions.

## Midnight Indexer 1.0.0 Release Notes

### Stable Release

* **Version**: 1.0.0
* **Audience**: Node operators, developers integrating with the Midnight ecosystem
* **Environment**: Production-ready

This release (1.0.0) is considered stable and production-ready. It can safely be deployed in public and production environments.

### Key Changes & Highlights

Midnight Indexer 1.0.0 is the first production release of the new Rust-based Indexer, replacing the legacy Scala implementation. It significantly improves performance, modularity, and deployment flexibility across environments.

:::note
This release requires wallet-sdk v4.0.0+ (compatible with Lace Wallet v2.0.0 or higher).
:::

* **Rust-Based Rewrite**: A full rewrite in Rust for enhanced performance, reliability, and maintainability.
* **Optimized Blockchain Data Processing**: Indexes Midnight blockchain data directly from node endpoints.
* **Wallet-Aware Indexing**: Links transactions with wallet addresses for personalized query results.
* **GraphQL API Support**: Offers queries, mutations, and real-time subscriptions.
* **Flexible Deployment**: Supports local single-binary deployments and distributed microservices for cloud environments.
* **Multiple Storage Backends**: Supports PostgreSQL (cloud) and SQLite (local/test).
* **Real-Time Event Subscriptions**: Enables listening for new blocks, contract events, and wallet-specific activity.

### Changelog

#### Added

* Rust-based implementation of Midnight Indexer
* GraphQL interface with query, mutation, and subscription support
* Event-driven real-time subscription system
* Wallet-aware transaction indexing
* SQLite support for local dev/test
* PostgreSQL support for production/cloud deployments

#### Changed

* Architecture moved from Scala monolith to modular Rust services

#### Deprecated

* Scala-based indexer (deprecated but still operational during transition)


### Breaking Changes

#### Migration from Scala-based to Rust-based indexer

**Impact**: API endpoints are similar, but internal implementation and performance characteristics differ
**Action Required**:

* Test integrations against the new Rust-based indexer at: `https://indexer-rs.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql`
* Begin migration from the old endpoint (`indexer.testnet-02...`)
* Monitor for upcoming deprecation of Scala indexer in future release

### Known Issues

* **macOS Compatibility**: Limited testing on macOS. Users may experience issues with native SQLite integration.
* **Windows Support**: Functional but not officially supported. Linux is the recommended environment.

### Compatibility

* **Operating Systems**: Fully supported on Linux. Limited support for macOS and Windows.
* **Third-Party Tools**: Compatible with monitoring and analytics platforms; may require minor configuration updates.
* **Midnight Ecosystem**: Fully compatible with Midnight node APIs and associated infrastructure.

### Additional Resources

* **Community Support**: Join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/midnightnetwork)

### Upgrade/Migration Guide

#### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL installed and configured (for production)
* Network access to a Midnight node

### Installation & Migration:

* Deploy new indexer binary
* Connect to appropriate backend (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
* Point your API integration to the new endpoint

###  Post-Upgrade Checks

* Confirm GraphQL queries resolve as expected
* Monitor logs for error-free startup
