# Midnight Indexer

The Midnight Indexer is a set of components designed to optimize the flow of blockchain data from a Midnight node to end-user applications. It retrieves history of blocks, processes them, stores indexed data efficiently, and provides a GraphQL API for queries and subscriptions.

:::

### Changelog

#### Bug Fixes

* Improved wallet session management by ensuring that active wallets are explicitly marked to avoid unintended disconnections.
* Fixed an issue where wallet subscriptions always restarted progress updates from index 0, regardless of the wallet's actual known index.

### Breaking Changes

#### Migration from Scala-based to Rust-based indexer

**Impact**: API endpoints are similar, but internal implementation and performance characteristics differ
**Action Required**:

* Test integrations against the new Rust-based indexer at: `https://indexer-rs.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql`
* Begin migration from the old endpoint (`indexer.testnet-02...`)
* Monitor for upcoming deprecation of Scala indexer in future release

### Known Issues

* **macOS Compatibility**: Limited testing on macOS. Users may experience issues with native SQLite integration.
* **Windows Support**: Functional but not officially supported. Linux is the recommended environment.

### Compatibility

* **Operating Systems**: Fully supported on Linux. Limited support for macOS and Windows.
* **Third-Party Tools**: Compatible with monitoring and analytics platforms; may require minor configuration updates.
* **Midnight Ecosystem**: Fully compatible with Midnight node APIs and associated infrastructure.
