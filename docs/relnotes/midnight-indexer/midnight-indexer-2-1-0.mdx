# Midnight Indexer

The Midnight Indexer is a set of components designed to optimize the flow of blockchain data from a Midnight node to end-user applications. It retrieves history of blocks, processes them, stores indexed data efficiently, and provides a GraphQL API for queries and subscriptions.

## Midnight Indexer 2.1.0 Release Notes

### Stable Release

* **Version**: 2.1.0
* **Audience**: Node operators, developers integrating with the Midnight ecosystem
* **Environment**: Production-ready

This release (2.1.0) is considered stable and production-ready. It can safely be deployed in public and production environments.

### Key Changes & Highlights

:::note
This release requires wallet-sdk v5.0.0+ (compatible with Lace Wallet v3.0.0 or higher).
:::

This 2.1.0 release just adds a single feature to the GraphQL API: add permissive CORS middleware to allow browsers executing dApps loaded from some origin (URL) to access the Midnight Indexer.

### Changelog

#### Features

* Added permissive CORS middleware

### Breaking Changes

#### Migration from Scala-based to Rust-based indexer

**Impact**: API endpoints are similar, but internal implementation and performance characteristics differ
**Action Required**:

* Test integrations against the new Rust-based indexer at: `https://indexer-rs.testnet-02.midnight.network/api/v1/graphql`
* Begin migration from the old endpoint (`indexer.testnet-02...`)
* Verify that your system meets the necessary dependencies for PostgreSQL and NATS (cloud) or SQLite (standalone).
* Ensure network access to a running Midnight Node.
* Notice that the Midnight Node 0.12.0 required a chain-reset and hence the storage (PostgreSQL/SQLite and NATS) need to be reset.

### Known Issues

* **macOS Compatibility**: Limited testing on macOS. Users may experience issues with native SQLite integration.
* **Windows Support**: Functional but not officially supported. Linux is the recommended environment.

### Compatibility

* Midnight Ecosystem: Fully compatible with Midnight Node 0.12 and related infrastructure.
* Operating Systems: Fully tested on Linux, with limited support for Windows and macOS.

### Additional Resources

* **Community Support**: Join the discussion on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/midnightnetwork)

### Upgrade/Migration Guide

#### Prerequisites

* PostgreSQL installed and configured (for production)
* Network access to a Midnight node

### Installation & Migration:

* Deploy new indexer binary
* Connect to appropriate backend (SQLite or PostgreSQL)
* Point your API integration to the new endpoint

###  Post-Upgrade Checks

* Confirm GraphQL queries resolve as expected
* Monitor logs for error-free startup
