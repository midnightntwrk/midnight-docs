Unshielded tokens can be owned by contracts, and subscriptions include sync progress data.

The API now supports system transactions, and `ApplyStage` has been renamed to `TransactionResult` with segment results.

### API improvements

The API now includes `ApiError` with client and server error types. 
Database query results use node-like default ordering, and error handling for network ID mismatches has been improved.

---

## Improvements

- Removed deprecated health endpoint.
- Removed obsolete metrics, added wallets connected gauge.
- Lowercase network ID validation at startup.
- Ledger state validation on save.
- Composite index on `transactions(variant, id)` for performance.
