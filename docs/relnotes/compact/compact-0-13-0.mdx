# Compact compiler 0.20.0 (Compact language 0.13.0)

Compact is Midnight's dedicated smart contract programming language, designed for building secure, efficient, and adaptable decentralized applications.

Compact compiler translates Compact smart contract code into executable bytecode and proof-generating circuits.

## Compact compiler 0.20.0 (Compact language 0.13.0) release notes

Today we are releasing version 0.20.0 of the Compact compiler. This release updates the Compact language to version 0.13.0, which includes some breaking changes from the previous Compact version 0.11.x.

This new release is available for you to download and try out. If you recompile your Compact code with the new version of the compiler, you may need to update the code for the breaking changes as described below. You are not required to upgrade to `compactc` 0.20.0 â€” you can continue to use `compactc` 0.19.x without updating your Compact code, and everything should still work. However, we do not plan to release any more bug fixes to `compactc` 0.19.x.

## Summary of Changes

### Language Changes

- **[Breaking change]** Include search order has changed.
- Modules can be imported from files.
- The standard library is now a builtin module.
- New structure creation syntax.
- Spread syntax in structure creation.
- **[Breaking change]** `new` is removed.
- Arrow circuit syntax for `map` and `fold`.
- **[Breaking change]** Anonymous circuit syntax is removed.
- Sequence ("comma") expressions allowed outside parentheses.

### Compiler Changes

- Improvements to error reporting.
- The order of exported circuits is the same in TypeScript as in Compact.
- The `install.sh` script is removed.
- Bug fixes.

## Language Changes

### **[Breaking Change]** Include Search Order Has Changed

In Compact, the `include` keyword is used to insert the full text of a Compact source file at a given point in a contract. Previously, the compiler searched the paths in the environment variable `COMPACT_PATH` (in order from left to right) to find the included file. Now, the compiler will:

1. First search for the included file relative to the directory of the including source file.
2. If not found, search for the file relative to the paths in `COMPACT_PATH`, still in order from left to right.

This change may require updating your code if the file found using the new search order differs from the file found using the old search order.

#### Why We Made This Change

It is more convenient to include files relative to the including fileâ€™s directory (e.g., the same directory, a subdirectory, or a sibling directory) without reconfiguring `COMPACT_PATH`. It also avoids potential conflicts when files with the same name exist in different parts of a source tree.

#### How to Fix Your Code

If this change breaks your code (e.g., by finding a different "local" file instead of the intended "global" file):

- Rename or move the undesired local file so that the new search order resolves to the intended file.

---

### Modules Can Be Imported from Files

Previously, all modules used by a contract had to be present in the main contract source file or an `include` file. Compact 0.13.0 now allows importing modules directly from separate files, enabling:

- Reusable utility modules.
- Clear separation between main contract code and utility code.

Modules can now be imported in two ways:

#### Importing by Name

```compact
import M0; // Import module M0
```

The compiler will search for a module named `M0` in the following order:

1. In scope (defined or imported at the top level).
2. As a file named `M0.compact` relative to the including fileâ€™s directory.
3. As a file named `M0.compact` in directories specified by `COMPACT_PATH`.

#### Importing by Path

```compact
import 'lib/M2'; // Import from relative path
import '/absolute/path/M3'; // Import from absolute path
```

When importing by path:

- The compiler appends `.compact` to the provided path.
- Relative paths are resolved relative to the importing file.
- Absolute paths are used as-is.

---

### The Standard Library Is Now a Builtin Module

Previously, the Compact standard library was provided as a file (`std.compact`) that developers needed to include manually. It is now a builtin module named `CompactStandardLibrary`. Developers can import it as follows:

```compact
import CompactStandardLibrary;
```

The `std.compact` file is still provided for backward compatibility, but its use is no longer required.

---

### New Structure Creation Syntax

A new syntax for creating structs has been introduced, inspired by TypeScript/JavaScript object literals. This syntax supports both positional and named field values, enabling more readable and flexible struct initialization:

```compact
struct Point {
  x: Uint<32>;
  y: Uint<32>;
}

Point { 3, 4 }       // Positional fields
Point { x: 3, y: 4 } // Named fields
Point { y: 4, x: 3 } // Named fields in any order
```

#### Why We Made This Change

The new syntax is more readable, especially for structs with many fields, and allows named fields to appear in any order.

#### How to Fix Your Code

Use the new struct creation syntax in place of the old `new` syntax (see the next section).

---

### Spread Syntax in Structure Creation

Compact now supports a "spread" operator (`...`) to create new struct values from existing ones. This eliminates the need to explicitly copy all fields when modifying a few:

```compact
struct ColorPoint {
  x: Uint<32>;
  y: Uint<32>;
  color: Color;
}

const cp0 = ColorPoint { 3, 4, Color.red };
const cp1 = ColorPoint { ...cp0, color: Color.green }; // Copy with modified color
```

---

### **[Breaking Change]** `new` Is Removed

The `new` syntax for struct creation has been removed in favor of the new structure creation syntax.

#### How to Fix Your Code

Replace `new StructName(...)` with `StructName { ... }`.

---

### Arrow Circuit Syntax for Procedure Calls, Map, and Fold

Compact now supports an arrow circuit syntax for use in `map` and `fold` expressions. This syntax is similar to TypeScript arrow functions:

```compact
map((x, y) => x + y, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]);
fold((x, y): Uint<8> => x * y, 1, [1, 2, 3]);
```

---

### **[Breaking Change]** Anonymous Circuit Syntax Is Removed

The old anonymous circuit syntax (using the `circuit` keyword) has been removed. Replace it with arrow circuit syntax.

#### How to Fix Your Code

For example:

```compact
// Old syntax
map(circuit (x, y) => x + y, [1, 2], [3, 4]);

// Updated syntax
map((x, y) => x + y, [1, 2], [3, 4]);
```

---

### Sequence Expressions Allowed Outside Parentheses

Sequence expressions (e.g., `expr1, expr2, expr3`) can now appear outside parentheses, aligning with TypeScript/JavaScript.

---

## Compiler Changes

### Improvements to Error Reporting

Error messages have been improved to provide clearer diagnostics and surface root causes of issues.

---

### Exported Circuits Order Matches Between TypeScript and Compact

The order of exported circuits in the generated TypeScript interface file now matches their order in the Compact source file.

---

### The `install.sh` Script Is Removed

The `install.sh` script, previously included with compiler releases, has been removed to reduce confusion.

---

### Bug Fixes

Several bug fixes have been included in this release, addressing developer-reported issues. We encourage feedback via our Discord server.
