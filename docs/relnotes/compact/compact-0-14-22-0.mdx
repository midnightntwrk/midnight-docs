# Compact compiler 0.22.0 (Compact language 0.14.0)

Compact is Midnight's dedicated smart contract programming language, designed for building secure, efficient, and adaptable decentralized applications.

Compact compiler translates Compact smart contract code into executable bytecode and proof-generating circuits.

## Compact compiler 0.22.0 (Compact language 0.14.0) release notes

Today we are releasing version 0.22.0 of the Compact compiler.  There are no
changes to the Compact programming language in this release.  `compactc` version
0.22.0 compiles the same language (Compact 0.14.0) as the previous released
compiler version 0.21.0.

This release does contain a number of bug fixes, so you should upgrade to
version 0.22.0.  The bug fixes are described below.


## Summary of Changes

This release includes the following bug fixes:

- Fix for an issue in ZK proofs for `Uint` circuit parameters
- Fix for an issue preventing coin insertion into ledger ADTs
- Fix for a crash when compiling `insert_index_default` for `MerkleTree`
- Fix for a crash when compiling `insert_default` for some `Map`s
- Fix for a crash when type checking incorrect programs
- Fix for a rare crash when reading the input file


## Bug Fixes

### Fix for an issue in ZK proofs for `Uint` circuit parameters

When a circuit had at least two parameters with `Uint` types, and those types
had sizes in bits that were not a power of two, we emitted incorrect code for
the ZK proof.  The generated JavaScript code was correct, but the proof server
would crash.  This is now fixed, the proof server will accept the proof.

### Fix for an issue preventing coin insertion into ledger ADTs

Inserting a coin into a ledger `List`, `Map`, or `Set` would fail when executing
the generated JavaScript code, with the message `Error: expected cell`.  This
was a bug in the Impact VM code that is used to update the ledger state.  This
is now fixed, the coin insertion will work.

### Fix for a crash when compiling `insert_index_default` for `MerkleTree`

The ledger ADT operation `insert_index_default` for `MerkleTree` would fail to
compile with the message `Internal compiler error (please report): Exception in
vmref-q`.  This issue is now fixed, the program will compile.

### Fix for a crash when compiling `insert_default` for some `Map`s

The ledger ADT operation `insert_default` for `Map`s would fail to compile when
the value type was a ledger ADT type.  The compiler fail with the message
`Internal compiler error (please report): Exception: failed assertion
(Ltypescript-Type? type)`. This issue is now fixed, the program will compile.

### Fix for a crash when type checking incorrect programs

In some cases where a ledger ADT type was used but the language required a
Compact type, the compiler would fail to compile the code with the message
`Internal compiler error (please report): Exception in infer-types: no matching
clause for input`.  This issue is now fixed, the compiler will signal a helpful
error message.

### Fix for a rare crash when reading the input file

In rare cases, when the range syntax (`..`) for `Uint` types or `for` loops
occurred at the boundary of a compiler-internal file input buffer, the compiler
would fail to compile with the message `Internal compiler error (please report):
Exception in unget-char: cannot unget #\\.`.  This issue is now fixed, the
program will compile.
