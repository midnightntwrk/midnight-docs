## Compact compiler 0.25.0 (Compact language 0.17.0) release notes

Today we are releasing version 0.25.0 of the Compact compiler.
This release updates the Compact language from version 0.16.0 to 0.17.0.

## Summary of Changes

This release has some new non-breaking (i.e., backward compatible) changes to the Compact language and standard libraries.
There are also some improvements to the compiler.

- Compact now supports casts between `Bytes` and `Vector` types
- `const` declaration statements now allow multiple constants
- The standard library gives access to block time
- The `compactc` compiler now allows contract filenames to have spaces in them
- The compiler prints a message when proof key generation fails
- The compiler prints a parse error when facing Unicode numeric characters other than 0-9


## Language changes

### Compact now supports casts between `Bytes` and `Vector` types

Compact has a type `Bytes<n>` parameterized over an unsigned size `n`.
It also hase a type `Vector<n, T>` parameterized of an unsigned size `n` and a Compact type `T`.
In Compact 0.17.0 we have added a typecast (using the Compact `as` operator) from `Bytes<k>` to `Vector<k, Uint<8>>` (for the same `k`).
We have also added a typecast from `Vector<k, Uint<8>>` to `Bytes<k>` (for the same `k`).

**Motivation:** the reason that these are distinct types in Compact is because they have different representations
and possibly different performance characteristics.
`Bytes` have a "packed" representation where the bytes are packed into larger numbers (specifically elements in the underlying prime field)
and need to be unpacked in order to access them.
`Vector`s have an "unpacked" representation where they are represented as fixed-size arrays of their elements.

Because of the different representations and the different costs of operations on them, `Vector`s have more operations
(such as indexing and iteration using `for` loops or `map` and `fold` operators) available on them than `Bytes` have.
We plan to eventually make all the same operations available for both types.
But in the meantime, it is not currently possible to work with `Bytes` in the same way that you can work with `Vector`s.

As a first step toward providing better support for `Bytes`, we have introduced casts back and forth to `Vector`s of `Uint<8>` elements.
This will allow you to unpack a value of `Bytes` type, operate on its elements, and iterate over it.
You will also be able to create vectors and have them packed into `Bytes` values.

:::warning
The casts back and forth between `Bytes` and `Vector`s will fully unpack and pack the result.
This will require a number of operations in the circuit proportional to the size of the `Bytes` or `Vector`.
This is potentially costly in terms of proving time (or might even cause you to hit fixed circuit size limits).
:::

This is a completely new feature and it is **not a breaking change** to the language.

### `const` declaration statements now allow multiple constants

Compact has `const` declaration statements that work like TypeScript's `const` declarations.
Before Compact language vesion 0.17, these only supported a single declaration per statement.
So, for instance, to declare two different constants you would write:

```compact
const x: Uint<8> = 127;
const y: Bytes<16> = pad(16, "Compact");
```

Now you can declare them on the same line, separated by a comma:

```compact
const x: Uint<8> = 127, y: Bytes<16> = pad(16, "Compact");
```

Note that any of the type annotations can still be omitted, in which case they will be inferred based on the type of the constant value.

**Motivation:** this is a change that makes the language more like TypeScript, where such declarations are possible.
It is intended to behave the same way as in TypeScript: you cannot refer to a constant before it is initialized
and you cannot have more than one binding for the same name in a `const` declaration.

This is a new capability for the the existing feature and it is **not a breaking change** to the language.

## New standard library and ledger APIs

### The standard library provides access to block time

A common request has been for contracts to be able to have some notion of time.
With Compact 0.17 we have added some new standard library circuits and some new ledger kernel operations for dealing with time.
These rely on the notion of "block time".
When running contract code in the DApp before submitting a transaction,
the block time will be a timestamp taken from the local machine before executing the contract entry point.
This time does not change during execution.
When running state updates on chain, the block time will be the approximate time of the block that the transaction is going into.

The Compact standard library exports circuits for comparing the block time to a specific time value.
There is a `blockTimeGt` (greater than) circuit with signature `blockTimeGt(time: Uint<64>): Boolean`.
The `time` argument is measured in seconds since the Unix epoch.
This circuit returns `true` if and only if the current block time is after the given time.
There are also `blockTimeGte` (greater than or equal), `blockTimeLt` (less than), and `blockTimeLte` (less than or equal) circuits in the standard library,
all with the same signature as `blockTimeGt`.

There are a pair of new ledger kernel operations used to support this feature.
The ledger kernel is exported as `kernel` from the standard library.
The new operations have signatures `blockTimeGreaterThan(time: Uint<64>): Boolean` and `blockTimeLessThan(time: Uint<64>): Boolean`.
The standard library circuits have simple implementations in terms of these kernel operations.
For instance, `blockTimeGt(t)` is implemented as `kernel.blockTimeGreaterThan(t)` and `blockTimeLte(t)` is implemented as `!kernel.blockTimeGreaterThan`.

So in general, you can just use the complete set of circuits provided by the standard library in your contracts.

This is **not a breaking change** to the standard library.

## Changes to generated code

With this release there will be some small changes to the generated JavaScript code produced by the compiler.
There are, however, **no changes** to the TypeScript API of generated contracts.

## Compiler changes

### The `compactc` compiler now allows contract filenames to have spaces in them

Previously you could not use `compactc` to compile contracts with spaces in the filename.
We have fixed that with this release and you can now compile these contracts by wrapping the entire input directory and filename in double quotes.

### The compiler prints a message when proof key generation fails

A separate executable named `zkir` is used during compilation to generate prover and verifier keys.
Before this release, when that executable failed without printing anything (for example, if it ran out of memory and crashed)
there was no indication of what went wrong.

With this release, the compiler detects such a failure, prints a message, and then the compiler fails with the exit code 255 (-1).

### The compiler prints a parse error when facing Unicode numeric characters other than 0-9

Previously you would get an internal error if you used Unicode numeric characters other than 0-9 in your contract.
We have now fixed this and the compiler throws a parse error when parsing such characters.
