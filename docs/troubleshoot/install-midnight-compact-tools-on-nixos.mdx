# Troubleshoot Compact toolchain installation issue on NixOS

Compact is Midnight’s dedicated smart contract programming language designed for building secure, efficient and adaptable decentralized applications. Compact tools are command-line utility for installing, updating, managing, and running the compact toolchain and compiler. This guide walks you through installing Midnight compact tools on NixOS.

### Compiler version scope

:::note 
Installation problems only concern versions of the compact compiler **0.26**. A fix has already been made and the guide will become obsolete upon official release of version 0.27.
:::

By the end of the guide, you will:
* Understand why standard installations fail on NixOS.
* Install and run compact for Midnight development.
* Fix “No such file or directory” errors for `compactc`.

### Prerequisites:
NixOS version 23.11, 24.05 or 25.11 **(recommended stable release)**.
Familiarity with command-line interfaces.

## Why standard installations fail on NixOS
Standard installations fail on NixOS because unlike traditional Linux distributions it is not configured to follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) which defines the directory structure and directory content in Linux operating systems. 
The main reason for this deviation is because it does not provide isolation, it instead uses the filesystem as a database and to store packages in isolation in a special directory called the Nix store. This causes issues when applications download binaries that expect a traditional FHS structure.

## Install the Compact compiler (FHS Environment)

To install the compiler, use `buildFHSEnv` a tool that creates a lightweight sandbox environment that simulates a traditional FHS system. It creates an isolated root filesystem with the host’s `/nix/store`, so its footprint in terms of disk space is quite small. This allows you to run software which is hard or unfeasible to patch for NixOS.

### Create shell.nix
Create a file called `shell.nix`:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
pkgs.buildFHSEnv {
  name = "x-11";
  targetPkgs = pkgs: [ pkgs.bash pkgs.glibc pkgs.curl];
  runScript = "exec ${pkgs.bash}/bin/bash";
}
```

Alternative for macOS (mkShell)
If you are on macOS, use this version of the file instead:
``` nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
pkgs.mkShell {
  name = "x-11";
  buildInputs = with pkgs; [
    bash
    glibc
    curl
  ];
}
```
### Run nix-shell
Run this command to enter the environment:
``` bash
nix-shell
```
### Download the Compact compiler
Inside the shell, run the installer:
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
```
### Update Compact
Once installed, update to the latest version:
```
compact update
```
## Fix “No such file or directory (os error 2)” error

*Create the utility script
Create a file called compact_util.sh:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cd ./.compact/versions/0.26.0/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
sed -i '1 i #!/usr/bin/env bash' compactc
```
*Make script executable
Run this command to change permissions:
```
chmod +x compact_util.sh
```
*Run the utility
Apply the fix by running:
```
./compact_util.sh
```
*Verify installation
Check that the compiler is now accessible:
```
compact compile --help
```
## Next steps
Midnight is a blockchain platform for building privacy-preserving DApps. It enables developers to define how data is isolated, verified, and shared through zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and programmable confidentiality controls.
