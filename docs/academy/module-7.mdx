# Module 7: Security and Best Practices for Midnight DApps

## Introduction

Midnight introduces new paradigms for decentralized applications (DApps), emphasizing privacy, zero-knowledge proof systems, and selective disclosure. This module summarizes the best practices developers should follow to maintain privacy, integrity, and security when building DApps on Midnight.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Apply zero-knowledge principles to enforce privacy-preserving logic in Compact smart contracts.
- Minimize data exposure using explicit disclosure and the principle of least disclosure.
- Architect DApps that handle sensitive user data without sending it on-chain.
- Use opaque types and proof-based validation patterns.
- Test your application securely in isolated environments using Midnight’s local stack.
- Ensure compatibility by tracking SDK updates and address format changes.

## Core Security Principles

### Leverage Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

Midnight DApps must use ZKPs to validate private data conditions without revealing the data itself. Contracts written in Compact rely on zkSNARKs, ensuring proofs are generated off-chain and only validation artifacts are submitted. Never design a workflow that depends on exposing raw private data for validation. Use ZKPs to prove knowledge, eligibility, or compliance.

### Enforce Explicit Disclosure

Compact treats all data as private by default. Developers must use the `disclose()` function when specific information must be shared. Review every disclosure call in your contract. Make sure the disclosure is necessary, documented, and limited in scope.

### Keep Private Data Off-Chain

Private data should never be sent to Midnight’s ledger or included in indexer requests. It must be processed by the proof server and referenced on-chain only through commitments. Ensure DApp frontends do not inadvertently expose private input values in API calls, query parameters, logs, or analytics tools.

### Follow the Principle of Least Disclosure

Design contracts to expose only the minimum amount of data required for functionality, regulation, or UX. Use proof-based flows (e.g., “over 18”, “verified voter”) instead of identity or full document disclosure.

Be mindful that even zero-knowledge proofs can leak information depending on how they’re structured. For example, proving that a user can bid up to a certain amount in an auction may unintentionally reveal that amount. Design proofs carefully to minimize unintended disclosure.

#### Example explained - the naïve auction

Suppose you design an auction where each bidder submits a ZK proof that they can pay up to a certain amount (say, 10 tokens). The proof proves knowledge of a balance `≥10`. But here's the catch:

* If you prove can bid up to 10, you're disclosing that your max bid is exactly 10.
* A more privacy-preserving way might be to prove "I can outbid the current highest bid" or "I can pay _some amount_ above X", without revealing what that amount is.

So even though it's a ZK proof, the way the proof is constructed leaks info (i.e., your exact budget).

#### Example explained – public key reuse vs. derived keys

Even public key strategies can inadvertently leak information. Many developers use `ZswapCoinPublicKey` (provided by the wallet) to simplify integration and composability. However, this convenience comes at a potential privacy cost.

If the same public key is used across multiple contracts, an observer can correlate interactions between contracts—even when the data itself is protected. For example:

* If Alice’s public key appears in two unrelated ledgers, a curious observer can infer that the same entity interacted with both contracts.
* This allows behavioral profiling (e.g., usage patterns, dApp preferences) even if balances or actions themselves remain hidden.

A more privacy-conscious approach is to derive a unique public key per contract, using inputs like a round ID or contract-specific salt. While this adds complexity (e.g., wallet portability, key migration), it prevents linkage between actions across contracts.

### Use Opaque Types for Sensitive Inputs

Opaque types allow user inputs to pass through the system without revealing internal structure or values to the contract. Use opaque wrappers whenever possible, especially for sensitive inputs such as credentials or identity proofs.

### Test in Isolated Environments

Midnight provides a local stack using Docker Compose. This allows developers to simulate contract execution, wallet flows, and proof generation without any external visibility. Always run unit and integration tests in a local environment before publishing contracts to TestNet-02.

### Stay Updated

Address formats (e.g., Bech32m) and APIs evolve. Midnight frequently updates the Lace wallet, Compact compiler, and SDKs. Track release notes and upgrade SDKs to avoid compatibility issues or broken signing workflows.

## Real-World Application Scenarios

### Secure Voting System

A voting DApp built on Midnight can verify eligibility without disclosing voter identity. Votes are encrypted and submitted to the ledger. Tallying is done using zero-knowledge aggregation, allowing for publicly auditable results without revealing how anyone voted.

### KYC-Compliant Token Sales

DApps can accept users who submit off-chain credentials (like passports) to a trusted party. That party then issues a verifiable credential, and the user generates a ZKP to prove facts—such as age or residency—without disclosing the underlying documents.

### Whistleblower Portal

Anonymous reporting DApps can prove that a complaint came from a verified internal user, without revealing identity. The report is encrypted on-chain and can only be decrypted by authorized investigators, maintaining anonymity and auditability.

### Private Asset Transfers

Midnight enables private transfers of tokenized assets (e.g., property or collectibles) where ownership changes are shielded. The history remains verifiable through proof chains, but the identities of transactors remain hidden unless explicitly disclosed to an authority.

### Data Marketplaces

Users can sell or share personal data by proving authenticity (e.g., "this chat log comes from a real user") without revealing the content until a transaction is finalized. Midnight allows the buyer to verify the proof without accessing the raw data upfront.

## Module Summary

This module covered key security practices for Midnight DApp development, including the use of zero-knowledge proofs, explicit data disclosure, and off-chain handling of private data. You learned how to apply opaque types, test securely in isolated environments, and stay aligned with the latest SDK and address formats. Real-world examples showed how these principles support secure, privacy-preserving applications on Midnight.
