# Midnight developer documentation

Welcome to the Midnight developer documentation. Here are resources about our blockchain, developer resources and communication resources.

## Learn about Midnight

Here you’ll learn all about [Midnight](https://midnight.network/), a new data-protection blockchain. Midnight enables apps that protect user, commercial, and transaction metadata. Its zero-knowledge ("ZK") proofs offer utility without compromising data protection or ownership. Explore Midnight’s technology stack, features, use cases, and differentiators in the blockchain and smart contract landscape.

## Midnight on Testnet

Midnight is at a 'testnet' stage, providing a stable sandbox environment to develop commercially successful on-chain applications that benefit from the transparency of a blockchain while addressing granular data protection needs.

- The goal of testnet is to provide developers building on Midnight with a reliable environment that simulates the conditions of a live mainnet. Midnight chain capabilities have been expanded and the codebase hardened to reduce the need for regularly scheduled chain resets when upgrading.
- Hard forks can now be initiated on Midnight testnet, which allows major upgrades to the network’s performance and features during testnet and beyond, without disrupting existing projects or requiring developers to redeploy their applications.
- Midnight’s programmable data protection capabilities give developers flexibility when selecting which data to make public on-chain and which to keep private.
- The zero-knowledge [ZK Snark](#) proving system ensures fast, efficient truth validation between [prover](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/glossary#prover) and [verifier](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/glossary#verifier) without requiring any additional interaction with the verifier. The proving system is upgradeable, not burdening developers with smart contract rewrites or redeployment.
- Midnight’s native programming language [Compact](#) – based on TypeScript - enables developers with little exposure to blockchain or zero-knowledge technology to quickly ramp up and begin writing smart contracts.

## Participate & influence

Since launching devnet, Midnight has introduced a number of ways for the community to provide feedback and contribute to the network's future development:

| Channel | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Midnight on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/midnightnetwork) | features regularly-scheduled community calls and support systems |
| [Midnight on Telegram](https://t.me/Midnight_Network_Official) | another onramp into our growing community |
| [Midnight on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@midnight.network) | videos provide context and techniques on using the Midnight blockchain |
| [Midnight blog](https://midnight.network/blog) | highlights milestones and noteworthy news |
| [Midnight hackathons](https://midnight.network/hackathon) | enable developers to learn and leverage Midnight’s data-protection capabilities |
| _[Nightpaper: A litepaper introducing Midnight](https://midnight.network/whitepaper)_ | explains how Midnight removes barriers preventing organizations from leveraging blockchain technology |

## Midnight development system requirements &#9888;

To build on Midnight, a suitable development environment on Linux, macOS, or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (WSL) is required. You’ll need sufficient resources to run a full non-block-producing node, a local proof server, the publish-subscriber indexer, and the client software. WSL running [Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/en/latest/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/) has been approved for testnet.

## Tailor & target your experience

### For developers new to blockchain

If it’s your first time building on a blockchain, we have an [introduction](./learn/introduction/what-is-midnight/) to Midnight's technology, a [developer tutorial](./develop/tutorial/), and [FAQs](./develop/faq).

### For developers familiar with blockchain & zero-knowledge technology

Visit our [Quick Start](https://docs.midnight.network/quickstart/) to begin building on Midnight.
