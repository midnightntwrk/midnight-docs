# Midnight developer documentation

Welcome to the Midnight developer documentation. Learn all about [Midnight](https://midnight.network/), a data-protection blockchain that enables applications to safeguard user, commercial, and transaction metadata. It uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to provide utility without compromising privacy.

Midnight’s <GlossaryTerm term="consensus mechanism" /> ensures all participants agree on the blockchain state while supporting secure, high-throughput, and privacy-preserving operations.

<summary><strong>Midnight is on Testnet</strong></summary>

Midnight is on testnet, providing a stable sandbox environment to develop commercially successful on-chain applications that benefit from the transparency of a blockchain while addressing granular data protection needs.

- The goal of testnet is to provide developers building on Midnight with a reliable environment that simulates the conditions of a live mainnet. Midnight chain capabilities have been expanded and the codebase hardened to reduce the need for regularly scheduled chain resets when upgrading.
- Hard forks can now be initiated on Midnight testnet, which allows major upgrades to the network's performance and features during testnet and beyond, without disrupting existing projects or requiring developers to redeploy their applications.
- Midnight's programmable data protection capabilities give developers flexibility when selecting which data to make public on-chain and which to keep private.
- The zero-knowledge [ZK Snark](/learn/02-understanding-midnights-technology/02-zero-knowledge-proofs) proving system ensures fast, efficient truth validation between [prover](/learn/04-glossary#prover) and [verifier](/learn/04-glossary#verifier) without requiring any additional interaction with the verifier. The proving system is upgradeable, not burdening developers with smart contract rewrites or redeployment.
- Midnight's native programming language [Compact](/develop/reference/compact/) – based on TypeScript - enables developers with little exposure to blockchain or zero-knowledge technology to quickly ramp up and begin writing smart contracts.

:::important
To build on Midnight, a suitable development environment on Linux, macOS, or [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (WSL) is required. You'll need sufficient resources to run a full non-block-producing node, a local proof server, the publish-subscriber indexer, and the client software. WSL running [Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.90.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 x86_64)](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/wsl/en/latest/howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2/) has been approved for testnet.
