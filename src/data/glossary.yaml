- term: Coin
  definition: >
    A coin is a digital asset that exists on a blockchain. It is a unit of account used as a store of value.
    Block producers are rewarded in coins, and coins are used to pay transaction fees. A coin is distinct from a
    token, which is any digital asset that means something to a decentralized application, including representing
    a real-world asset. That means all coins are tokens, but not all tokens are coins.

- term: Compact
  definition: >
    Compact is the domain-specific language, based on TypeScript, in which Midnight's smart contracts are expressed.
    While the language does allow contracts to be expressed concisely, the primary derivation of the name is from
    the noun form of the word *compact*, meaning an agreement, contract, or covenant among people or institutions.

- term: Concurrency
  definition: >
    Concurrency is the ability of many users to perform tasks simultaneously without blocking each other.
    This ensures increased throughput and makes transaction and smart contract processing more efficient.

- term: consensus mechanism
  id: consensus-mechanism
  definition: >
    The consensus mechanism of a blockchain is the set of rules that govern the way that the participants in
    the network agree to add blocks to the chain. Each block must conform to the chain’s rules, and the blocks
    must be chained in the correct sequence, avoiding or resolving forks in the chain.

- term: Cryptocurrency
  definition: >
    A digital asset stored on a blockchain ledger that is intended to be used as a medium of exchange for goods
    or services. Blockchain protocols use cryptography to ensure the security and verification of ownership and
    fund movements. Unlike traditional currencies, a cryptocurrency is not controlled by a government.
    Its value is determined by the dynamics of market supply and demand.

- term: Custom spend logic
  definition: >
    A term used to indicate a potential feature of Midnight, where spending a coin involves executing attached
    logic so that certain invariants of token lifecycle can be enforced. An example use case may be requiring
    a known/allowed source of tokens.

- term: Custom token
  definition: >
    Custom tokens are user-defined tokens designed to fulfill specific features and functionalities, like voting
    and governance. Custom tokens in Midnight are managed by the ledger alongside Midnight’s native tokens using
    the same mechanics.

- term: DApp
  definition: >
    A DApp, short for decentralized application, is a computer program that operates on a network without a single
    central server, typically a blockchain.

- term: DApp developer
  definition: >
    An individual or organization that creates and maintains DApps.

- term: DApp operator
  definition: >
    An individual or organization responsible for the management, operation, and support of a decentralized application.
    DApp operators often engage DApp developers, or are themselves DApp developers.

- term: Decentralized
  definition: >
    A system or organization where there is no single authority in control. Instead, the system or organization is run
    by numerous decision makers with equal or comparable standing.

- term: Devnet
  definition: >
    Short for ‘development network’, a devnet is a blockchain that behaves like the Mainnet and is used for testing
    DApps that are in development. It uses test tokens with no value. Some governance parameters may be set differently
    from Mainnet for the convenience of developers. In Midnight, the process of DApp deployment proceeds from a devnet
    to one or more testnets (such as preview and pre-production) before the DApp is released on the Mainnet. Midnight's
    `devnet` has been deprecated in favor of the current `testnet`.

- term: Testnet
  definition: >
    Short for ‘test network’, a testnet is a blockchain that behaves like the Mainnet and is used for testing DApps
    that are in development. Midnight is currently at the testnet stage; evolving eventually to a Mainnet release.

- term: Distributed
  definition: >
    A blockchain is distributed because a copy of it is stored on many computers across the world.

- term: Domain separator
  definition: >
    A field used when a DApp asks a user to sign a message. It helps ensure that a message from one DApp cannot be
    used in a different DApp or on a different network.
