# Testnet-02 transition & the roadmap to Mōhalu

As we progress through the **Hilo** phase and prepare for the upcoming milestones of the Midnight Network, we are adjusting testing environments to ensure a seamless transition to a decentralized mainnet.

Midnight `Testnet-02` has been a monumental success, serving as the crucible for Midnight’s zero-knowledge capabilities. We want to extend our deepest gratitude to the over **180+** Cardano Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) who actively participated in the `Testnet-02` environment and their ongoing support for the Midnight project. 

In previous communications, we signaled that SPOs would migrate directly to the Midnight `Preview` environment at this stage. However, as we refine the roadmap toward the **Kūkolu** (Federated Mainnet) phase, we have made a strategic pivot.

While `Testnet-02` validators may continue to run their nodes until **February 28, 2026**, the Midnight `Preview` environment will be temporarily maintained by core engineering. This shift allows us to:

* Perform high velocity testing and rapid iterations.  
* Finalize the integration of novel features such as the DUST Capacity Exchange.  
* Ensure a stable, rapid-test environment for core development that would otherwise cause unnecessary disruption and downtime for independent SPOs.

| Phase    | Milestone              | SPO & Validator Role                                      |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hilo     | Token Genesis          | Initial liquidity and NIGHT "Glacier Drop" on Cardano.            |
| Kūkolu   | Federated Mainnet      | Ecosystem partners maintain stability during rapid development.   |
| Mōhalu   | Incentivized Mainnet   | SPO Onboarding begins including other testing.                    |
| Hua      | Full Decentralization  | Block production transitions to community.                        |

This keeps the structure clean and focused on phases, milestones, and roles.

*Please note: All dates are estimates.*

We acknowledge that this change differs from previous expectations, but we believe this path ensures the highest quality environment for SPOs to return for **Mōhalu**.

## Validator documentation status

To avoid confusion during this transition, **current validator documentation will be temporarily unpublished** or hidden from the main site. This ensures that **when you return to the docs for the Mōhalu phase, they will be 100% accurate**, refreshed, and aligned with the new architecture.

## Direct action on your feedback

We recently conducted a feedback survey to understand your operational experience. We heard your feedback regarding documentation, setup friction, and infrastructure control. In preparation for the **Mōhalu** phase, we are implementing the following changes:

- We are moving away from a Docker-only distribution. We are now delivering pre-compiled binaries for `midnight-node` and restructuring our documentation to be binary and source-first. While containerization is useful, we recognize that barebones instructions are fundamental for professional SPO infrastructure.
- The next node version will completely remove the registration wizard, allowing for a more direct and scriptable registration process.
- We are prioritizing new architecture recommendation for secrets management and air-gapped signing guidance. We recognize that for a privacy-focused chain, the security of our validators' keys is paramount.
- In the lead up to Mōhalu, we promise more structued communication cadence and dedicated SPO/ validator calls.
