# Learning Web3 from the Ground Up: A Quick History of Blockchain and Why Tokens Matter

I’m still in the early stages of my Web3 learning journey (see my previous posts on the [Midnight Dev Diaries](https://docs.midnight.network/blog)!), and each week unveils new insights and "aha" moments for me. This week, I delved deeper into the Intro to Blockchain section of [Cardano Academy](https://academy.cardanofoundation.org/), along with [Module 1 of the Midnight Developer Academy](https://docs.midnight.network/academy/module-1). Rather than just focusing on the technical aspects and step-by-step guides, I shifted my attention to understanding the evolution of blockchain platforms over time, particularly the journey from Bitcoin to more advanced systems like Midnight. This exploration also led me to reflect on the crucial role that tokens play in the functionality and sustainability of decentralized systems. Tokens aren't just mere digital assets; they serve as the economic backbone that incentivizes participation and secures the network. In this post, I want to share two significant topics that helped clarify my understanding this week:

1. How blockchain platforms have progressed from Bitcoin to Midnight  
2. How tokens keep decentralized systems running through economic incentives

Let's jump in!

## The Evolution of Blockchain Platforms

When I first heard about blockchain, I mostly associated it with Bitcoin. However, after diving into more educational content, it became clear that this space has undergone multiple waves of innovation, each building on the last. Here's how we got from the first Bitcoin transaction to the emergence of privacy-focused blockchains like Midnight.

### Bitcoin (2009): A New Way to Move Money

Blockchain began with Bitcoin, launched in 2009 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. It introduced the idea of a decentralized, peer-to-peer payment network where anyone could send money without relying on banks or intermediaries. Transactions were validated through **proof-of-work** and recorded on a public ledger that anyone could inspect—but no one could alter.

This was revolutionary. Bitcoin proved that decentralized digital money was possible—and, in 2010, someone even traded 10,000 BTC for two pizzas. That transaction is now famous for being the first real-world use of Bitcoin and the most expensive pizza ever bought.

Still, Bitcoin was narrowly focused: it could securely transfer value but not much else.

### Ethereum (2015): The Rise of Programmable Blockchains

Ethereum took the core idea of blockchain and expanded it into something far more flexible. It introduced **smart contracts**—self-executing programs that live on the blockchain and run when certain conditions are met. This turned Ethereum into what its creators called a "world computer": a decentralized platform for building applications that couldn't be shut down or censored.

Ethereum is guided by six key principles:

- **Atomicity**: All or nothing execution 
- **Synchrony**: Consistent state across nodes
- **Provenance**: Trackable origins
- **Permanence**: Durable data storage
- **Immortality**: Apps that can't be turned off  
- **Immutability**: Data that can't be changed once written

These principles laid the groundwork for DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs, giving rise to an entire ecosystem of decentralized applications. However, this flexibility came with trade-offs, especially around scalability and high transaction fees.

### Third-Generation Platforms: Cardano and Beyond

Enter the third generation of blockchains. These platforms aim to solve the Blockchain Trilemma: how to balance scalability, security, and decentralization—without sacrificing any of them.

Cardano, launched in 2017, is one of the most notable examples. It uses **proof-of-stake** to reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency. But what stood out most to me is that it was built from the ground up with formal research and peer-reviewed design—a very different approach from its predecessors.

Cardano also addresses security at the protocol level. Unlike Ethereum, where new tokens are created via smart contracts (which can introduce vulnerabilities), tokens on Cardano are treated as **native assets**. This means they inherit the same security guarantees as the platform's native currency, ADA, and don't require a custom contract to be created or maintained.

Other improvements include:

- Layer 2 scaling solutions like Hydra  
- Support for sidechains to improve interoperability  
- A focus on sustainability by reducing resource consumption through staking is also needed

### Midnight: The Privacy Layer of the Future

Midnight represents a new phase in blockchain evolution focused on privacy and regulatory compliance.

It uses tools like [zero-knowledge proofs](https://docs.midnight.network/learn/understanding-midnights-technology/zero-knowledge-proofs) to allow data to remain private on a public blockchain. At the same time, it supports selective disclosure, meaning users can prove compliance (for example, with regulations or audits) without revealing everything. In other words, Midnight blends the decentralization and transparency of blockchain with the privacy needed for real-world use cases—whether it's secure communication, confidential data sharing, or regulated financial applications.

## Tokenomics 101: Why Tokens Are More Than Just Coins

Once I understood how blockchains evolved, the next big question was: How do they keep running without a central company in charge? The answer lies in tokenomics, the economic design behind each network.

### Tokens as Utility

Every blockchain has a native token—Bitcoin has BTC, Ethereum has ETH, Cardano has ADA. But tokens aren't just money. Tokens are **used** to pay transaction fees, deploy contracts, access network features, and more.

This creates a built-in incentive system. If using the network requires tokens, and the network is valuable, then tokens have value too.

### Tokens as Incentives

Blockchain networks need participants to validate transactions, secure the network, and maintain consensus. In return, they reward those participants with tokens.

For example:

- Miners earn BTC for adding blocks to the Bitcoin chain.  
- Validators earn ADA in Cardano's proof-of-stake system to secure the network.

These rewards are often inflationary, meaning new tokens are regularly minted and distributed. However, that inflation funds the network's infrastructure.

### **Tokens as Governance Tools**

Some tokens also allow holders to vote on decisions. In DAO-style systems, governance tokens let users decide protocol upgrades, fee structures, or treasury spending. This turns token holders into active stakeholders, not just passive investors.

### Inflationary vs. Deflationary Models

The way a token's supply is designed can shape behavior:

- Inflationary models (e.g., Polkadot) continually mint new tokens to incentivize active participation.  
- Deflationary models (e.g., Bitcoin) cap the total supply or burn tokens to reduce circulation.

Each model has trade-offs: Inflation can reward contributors but reduce long-term value, while deflation can increase scarcity but discourage spending.

Many modern projects use hybrid models. For example, Ethereum burns a portion of transaction fees to offset inflation while still issuing new tokens to validators.

## Conclusion

Understanding where blockchain originated and how tokens drive these systems provided me with a much clearer view of the ecosystem I'm entering. It's not just about code or decentralization for its sake. It's about designing systems where people are economically motivated to do the right thing. And just like the technology itself, the economics behind blockchains are still evolving.

If you're learning Web3 too or just curious how all the pieces fit together, be sure to take a look at the [Midnight docs](https://docs.midnight.network/), [Dev Diaries](https://docs.midnight.network/blog), and the newly published modules in the [Midnight Developer Academy](https://docs.midnight.network/academy/module-1). 

More foundational concepts are coming next week—stay tuned!
