A major Midnight Testnet upgrade introduces version 1.5, bringing key changes that require validator re-registration, improved node setup, and enhanced tooling for partner-chain participants.

# Learning Web3 from the Ground Up: Hash Functions & Digital Signatures

One of the major changes of the [Midnight Testnet upgrade](https://midnight.network/blog/upcoming-testnet-02-upgrade-all-you-need-to-know) is the leap from Partner-Chains version 1.2 to 1.5. This particular change requires Midnight validators to re-register.

## Why is Midnight taking a leap from 1.2 to 1.5?

The testnet was operating on v1.2. The upgrade path through v1.4 (specifically the v1.3 -> v1.4 transition) introduced breaking changes in the partner-chain contracts, necessitating a chain reset. To bypass this incompatible intermediate state and minimize disruption, we opted for a direct deployment of the latest stable release, v1.5. 

## How to become a Midnight block producer?

1. Follow the docs to register your SPO and run a Midnight validator node. The validate section of the Midnight documentation has been updated to reflect the latest changes: https://docs.midnight.network/validate/run-a-validator/
2. Join the Midnight Discord and discuss any questions, issues, or suggestions for improvement in the 📊｜block-producers channel: https://discord.com/invite/midnightnetwork
3. See [Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.midnight.network/relnotes/support-matrix) for supported component verrsions.

Key changes:

| Feature/Aspect | v1.2 | v1.5 |
|----------------|------|------|
| **CLI Tools** | Users required `partner-chains-cli` and `pc-contracts-cli` binaries, invoked with `./partner-chains-cli <commands>`. | Wizards integrated into `midnight-node` commands, e.g., `./midnight-node wizards --help`. No need for separate binaries. |
| **Docker Repository** | Hosted at `midnight-ntwrk/midnight-node-docker` (now archived). | Moved to `midnightntwrk/midnight-node-docker` under the official Midnight Foundation org. |
| **Service Ports** | Required both Ogmios and Kupo service ports for contract interactions (e.g., registering). | Only Ogmios service port required. |
| **Keystore Directory** | Located at `data/chains/testnet-02/…`. | Uses `data/chains/partner_chains_template/…`. New keys generated in `data/chains/undeployed/…` (workaround: rename `undeployed` to `partner_chains_template`). |
| **Key Support** | No extended key support; users (e.g., CNTools) had to create new key sets. | Supports BIP32-Ed25519 extended keys. |
| **Memory Recommendation** | ~32GB for `midnight-node`. | Reduced to ~16GB due to ledger optimizations. |

Common questions:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| I was already registered to testnet-02 before this upgrade. Do I have to register again? | Yes. The committee candidate list is completely reset. Therefore, you need to register again. |
| I was already registered to testnet-02 before the upgrade. Do I need to deregister? | No. Simply register again to Testnet-02 with the latest Midnight-node version. |
| Can I use my existing keys? | Yes. Use them for the registration sequence. |
| I was already registered to testnet-02 before the upgrade. In what order should I go about re-registering? | 1. Optional: Backup your Partner-chain keys if you intend to reuse the same keys.<br />2. Stop the Midnight-validator node and delete the Midnight-node db.<br />3. Register using the latest documentation.<br />4. Run the latest Midnight-node in validator mode and produce blocks. |
| I’m not an existing Midnight validator, but interested in registering my SPO as one. Do I have to re-register? | 1. Register using the latest documentation.<br />2. Run the latest Midnight-node in validator mode and produce blocks. |
| Is Cardano-db-sync still required? | Yes. The Midnight-node needs a persistent connection to Cardano-db-sync. v1.5 only eliminates the Kupo service from the Partner-chains stack. |
