# Introducing the Compact Developer Tools

We are proud to announce the launch of the Compact developer tools!
Today we are launching `compact`, a command-line tool that is used for installing the Compact toolchain (e.g., the compiler),
keeping it up to date, and invoking the toolchain tools themselves.
The developer tools are now the "official" supported way to install and update the toolchain and to invoke other Compact tooling such as the Compact compiler.

To avoid confusion, we will make a careful distinction between the "Compact toolchain" and the "Compact developer tools".
The toolchain contains the compiler and will eventually contain other tooling that is specific to a particular version of the Compact language.
The developer tools include the updater tools and will eventually support other tools that work consistently across different versions of the language.
In the initial release, the Compact developer tools are primarily used to manage the installation of a Compact toolchain, but they will support additional tooling in the future.

There is no new release of the Compact toolchain yet, but you can already start using the new developer tools to install and invoke the current version of the compiler.

# The Old Toolchain Installation Method

Before this new release, installing the Compact toolchain was a manual and tedious process:

1. Developers had to download a ZIP file for a specific compiler version and platform architecture
1. They then had to extract it to a directory included in their PATH
1. On macOS, they would have to give permission to run the two different binaries (the compiler and the ZK-key generator).

This process would have to be repeated each time there was a new Compact toolchain release.
Keeping multiple versions installed at once was also cumbersome and hard to manage.

# The New Toolchain Installation Method

The new way to install the Compact toolchain starts with a one-time installation of the `compact` command-line tool.
Once installed, the developer tools can update themselves automatically.
To install, run the following command:

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/midnightntwrk/compact/releases/latest/download/compact-installer.sh | sh
```

This command will download and run a shell script.
It will instruct you how to add the binary directory it uses to your `PATH` environment variable.

Once you've done this, the `compact` command line tool is available to use.
This tool has a number of useful subcommands that can be invoked.
For instance, to **update** the toolchain to the latest version, you will run the command:

```
compact update
```

The output will look something like this (on an Apple Silicon macOS machine, for instance):

```
compact: aarch64-darwin -- 0.24.0 -- installed
compact: aarch64-darwin -- 0.24.0 -- default.
```

This subcommand will switch to the latest version of the toolchain available for your architecture.
As of today, this is version 0.24.0 which is reported by the tool.
The `compact` tool will download the toolchain artifacts if necessary (you will see a progress meter while it downloads).
If you have already downloaded the artifacts, the tool will simply switch the default version to be the latest version.

When there is a new Compact toolchain release, such as 0.25.0, you will use the same subcommand as above to update to that new version.

You can **check** if there is a new version available using the `check` subcommand like this:

```
compact check
```

If there is a new version available, you will see something like:

```
compact: aarch64-darwin -- Update Available -- 0.24.0
compact: Latest version available: 0.25.0.
```

This is reporting that you are on version 0.24.0 and that 0.25.0 is available.

:::note
You will not actually see this output until there is a new version available.
Instead, you will see that you are on the latest version:

```
compact: aarch64-darwin -- Up to date -- 0.24.0
```
:::

# Switching Toolchain Versions

You can also "update" to any other available toolchain, including previous ones.
You can **list** all the versions available with the command:

```
compact list
```

The output will look something like this:

```
compact: available versions

→ 0.24.0 - x86_macos, aarch64_macos, x86_linux
  0.23.0 - aarch64_macos, x86_linux
  0.22.0 - x86_macos, x86_linux
```

This is showing the different versions, and which platforms they are available for.
The arrow indicates the current default version, 0.24.0 in this case.
This default is whichever you have currently set as the default (via `compact update`).

You can pass the flag `--installed` (or `-i`) to `compact list` to see the versions that are actually downloaded locally:

```
compact list --installed
```

The output will probably look like this:

```
compact: installed versions

→ 0.24.0
```

The update subcommand can be used with a specific version to switch to that version.
For example:

```
$ compact update 0.23.0
compact: aarch64-darwin -- 0.23.0 -- installed
compact: aarch64-darwin -- 0.23.0 -- default.

$ compact list --installed
compact: installed versions

  0.24.0
→ 0.23.0
```

:::note
If you are on an Intel x86 macOS computer, you will not be able to update to version 0.23.0 because it was not available for that architecture.
You can try the same commands above with version 0.22.0 instead.
:::

You can now switch back to the latest version with `compact update` or `compact update 0.24.0`.
This time, nothing will be downloaded because that version is already installed locally.

# Invoking the Compiler

In addition to keeping the toolchain updated, the `compact` tool will also be the official supported way to invoke all the toolchain tools themselves.
For the time being, the only such tool is the compiler, but we will be building out more tools in the future.
The compiler can be invoked with the `compile` subcommand:

```
compact compile <contract file> <output directory>
```

This will use the current default version of the toolchain (the one indicated by the arrow in `compact list`).

:::note
If you are using macOS, you no longer have to explicitly give permission to run the compiler and ZK-key generation binaries.
:::

You can override the default to use a specific (already installed) version by including the version number after a plus (`+`) sign like:

```
compact compile +0.23.0 <contract file> <output directory>
```

Looking ahead, we plan to remove the `compactc` executable.
Going forward, `compact compile` will become the standard way to invoke the Compact compiler.

# Built-in Help

The `compact` tool and all of its subcommands have detailed help pages provided by the tools themselves.
You can see these in two different ways, either using the `help` subcommand or by using the `--help` flag.

For the Compact tool itself, you can invoke `compact help` or `compact --help` and you will see the exact same help page.
This page shows all the subcommands (`compile` is currently listed at the bottom of the page).
It also shows common command line options.

For a specific subcommand, such as `update`, you can see detailed help either via `compact help update` or `compact update --help`.
You can use the help pages to find all the subcommands and their options.

:::note
Because of the way that the tools are currently implemented, you cannot get compiler help via `compact help compile`.
Instead, you will have to use `compact compile --help`.
:::

# Versions

The developer tools are separately versioned from the toolchain (i.e., compiler) itself.
This is because the tools are capable of managing multiple versions of the toolchain.

You can see the version of the developer tools with `compact --version`.
That should currently be 0.1.0.
You can also see the version of subcommands like `compact update --version`.
Currently, built-in subcommands (that is, ones implemented by the developer tools, not the toolchain) all have the same version as the developer tools.

You can find the version of the toolchain with `compact list -i` or `compact check` (though the latter will make an Internet check to see if there is a new version).
You can also find it from the compiler via `compact compile --version`.
This should currently be 0.24.0 if you are on the latest version.

As before, the Compact language itself is versioned separately from the toolchain.
You can find this from the compiler via `compact compile --language-version`.

# Keeping the Developer Tools Up to Date

Once they are installed, the developer tools are capable of keeping themselves up to date.
You can check for updates with `compact self check`, and you can update to the latest version of the tool with `compact self update`.

We have not provided a way to go back to a previous version of the developer tools themselves, because you generally won't need to do that.
You don't necessarily have to update the developer tools themselves all the time, either.
You **will** however want to update the developer tools themselves when we make more developer tools available.
For example, a future release will include a Compact formatter available via a `compact format` subcommand.
You will need to update the developer tools themselves to get access to the formatter tool.
We will always announce such updates in the release notes for both the toolchain and the developer tools.

# How it Works

The tool is currently a simple one, but its architecture is flexible and it will eventually support many more different developer tools.
If you look at the help pages, you will see that the tools take a `--directory` command-line flag which tells them where to find the toolchain.
By default this will be the directory `.compact` in your home directory.

If you look in that directory, you will see two subdirectories: `bin` and `versions`.
The `versions` subdirectory contains separate subdirectories for each installed version, which contain the toolchain artifacts for that version.
The `bin` subdirectory represents the default version, which is just a symbolic link to one of the installed versions.

The command line tool is capable of checking for updates and downloading and unzipping toolchain artifacts if necessary.
Switching between installed versions just changes the `bin` symbolic link to point to a different installed toolchain.
Invoking the toolchain itself just invokes the corresponding default executables in the `bin` directory, or for a specific version if necessary.
