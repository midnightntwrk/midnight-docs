# Midnight Core Call 1 - Testnet Upgrade

**Date**: April 10, 2025  
**Time**: 12:00 PM EDT  
**Topic**: Midnight Testnet Upgrade (Partner-Chains 1.5, BLS, Ledger Support)


## Agenda

1. Midnight Testnet Upgrade Overview
2. Impact on Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)
3. Impact on Developers
4. Estimated Timeline
5. Q&A

## Meeting Notes

### Midnight Testnet Upgrade Overview

- Discussed the upcoming Midnight testnet upgrade as detailed in the [official blog post](https://midnight.network/blog/upcoming-testnet-02-upgrade-all-you-need-to-know).

### Impact on Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)

- SPOs are required to re-register for the upgrade.
- Improved user experience (UX) for registration:
  - No dependency on Kupo.
  - No need for `pc-contracts-cli`.
  - Support for extended keys.
  - Enhanced performance for `midnight-node`.

### Impact on Developers

- Developers will be expected to update all Midnight components, including:
  - Midnight JS
  - Wallet
  - Faucet
- The proving system will transition from Pluto-Eris to BLS, requiring BLS-compatible components.
- Compact contracts should remain functional but will need:
  - Recompilation with BLS support using the proof-server.
  - Redeployment.

### Estimated Timeline

- **ETA**: Around May 2025 (potentially late April or early May).
- A precise maintenance window will be communicated proactively.
- Stakeholders are advised to monitor for updates on the exact ETA.

## Q&A Session

**Q: Is it possible to eliminate the need for `db-sync` in the future?**

- Feedback about `db-sync` has been noted and shared with partner-chains.
- For Partner-Chains v1.5 (the version targeted for this upgrade), Kupo has been eliminated.

**Q: Where is SPO registration stored if it’s not on-chain, and what happens if the database is removed?**

- Registrations are stored on the Cardano preview testnet within Midnight’s partner-chain contract.
- Due to the reset, re-registration will be required.
- Suggested upgrade sequence:
  1. Re-register.
  2. Update to the latest `midnight-node` version.
  3. Delete the old `midnight-node` database.
  4. Run `midnight-node` in validator mode.

**Q: Will Midnight Core Calls be recurring?**

- Yes, scheduled for the second Thursday of every month.
- Additional calls may be organized based on need.

**Q: Is there a benchmark for transactions in the Battleship game? (Brick Towers offered to test)**

- No specific benchmarks have been established yet.
- Game rounds are expected to be significantly faster.

**Q: When will the upgrade roll out?**

- Target is near May 2025, potentially late April or early May.
- A precise maintenance window will be communicated soon.

## Action Items

- **MN Team**: Will share precise maintenance window and ETA for the upgrade.
- **SPOs**: Prepare for re-registration and update to Partner-Chains v1.5.
- **Developers**: Will be expected to update Midnight components and recompile/deploy contracts with BLS support.
- **All**: Join the [Block-Producers](https://discord.com/channels/1165826384975908924/1328720589548032032) channel on Discord to engage in deeper conversations with fellow SPOs.
