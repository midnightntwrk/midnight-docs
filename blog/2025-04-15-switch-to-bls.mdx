# Midnight's Proving System is Switching from Pluto Eris to BLS

Midnight leverages the [Kachina](https://iohk.io/en/research/library/papers/kachina-foundations-of-private-smart-contracts/) protocol for privacy-preserving smart contracts using Universal Composition (UC) model to enable secure, decentralized computations with zero-knowledge proofs, splitting contracts state into public (on-chain) and private (off-chain) components for scalable privacy.

Midnight currently uses ZK-SNARKs based on the Kachina framework with the [Pluto-Eris](https://github.com/daira/pluto-eris) cryptographic curves for its proving system, ensuring privacy-preserving smart contracts. As part of the upcoming [Testnet upgrade](https://midnight.network/blog/upcoming-testnet-02-upgrade-all-you-need-to-know), Midnight plans to switch to the [BLS12-381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381) curve to improve efficiency and security, leveraging BLS12-381’s pairing-based properties to enhance performance in transactions.

## Why Midnight is switching to BLS

|                              | Pluto-Eris                         | BLS12-381                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Trusted Setup**            | Needs ceremony                     | Existing                         |
| **Cryptography**             | Non-standard                       | Standard                         |
| **Transaction time**         | Slower                             | Faster                           |
| **Transaction size**         | 6 kb / proof                       | 5 kb / proof                     |
| **Tx verification time**     | 12 ms / proof                      | 6 ms / proof                     |
| **Architectural complexity** | High                               | Low                              |
| **Maintainability**          | Hard                               | Feasible                         |
| **Cost of recursive step**   | Smaller circuits / higher CPU cost | Larger circuits / lower CPU cost |

### Moving away from trusted setup ceremony

One of the most compelling reasons to adopt BLS12-381 is its use of an existing, standardized trusted setup. Pluto-Eris, by contrast, requires a bespoke ceremony. With BLS12-381, we leverage a pre-established setup that has already been widely vetted and accepted in the cryptographic community.

### Embracing standardized cryptography

Pluto-Eris relies on non-standard cryptography, which, while innovative, poses risks in terms of interoperability and long-term support. BLS12-381, however, is built on standard cryptographic primitives that are well-understood, extensively tested, and broadly adopted. Standardization reduces the likelihood of vulnerabilities and ensures compatibility with other systems, making BLS12-381 a more future-proof choice.

### Boosting transaction performance

Performance is a critical factor in any cryptographic system, and BLS12-381 outshines Pluto Eris across several key metrics. Transactions on BLS12-381 are faster, with verification times slashed from 12 milliseconds per proof in Pluto Eris to just 6 milliseconds. Additionally, transaction sizes are more compact, dropping from 6 kilobytes per proof to 5 kilobytes, allowing for more efficient use of bandwidth and storage. These improvements translate to a smoother, more scalable user experience across the Midnight platform.

### Simplifying architecture and maintenance

Architectural complexity is another area where BLS12-381 has a clear edge. Pluto Eris is burdened by a high level of complexity, making it harder to maintain.

### Balancing cost and efficiency in recursion

Recursive proofs are a cornerstone of advanced cryptographic applications, and the two systems handle them differently. Pluto Eris delivers smaller circuits but at a higher CPU cost, which can strain computational resources as usage scales. BLS12-381 flips this tradeoff, opting for larger circuits with a lower CPU cost.

In short, BLS12-381 offers a compelling blend of performance, simplicity, and reliability than Pluto Eris.

## 💥 Impact on Developers

The transition to BLS12-381 is set for April 28, 2025, as part of the Testnet upgrade. This change is not backward compatible, requiring developers to adopt BLS-compatible components for the BLS era of Testnet. These components include:

- midnight.js
- wallet
- examples
- proof-server

Meanwhile, existing Compact code should remain functional but will require recompilation and redeployment to align with the new BLS12-381 standard. While the transition to BLS12-381 requires some effort, we believe it will pave the way for a significantly more performant developer experience with faster transactions.
