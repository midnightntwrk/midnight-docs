# Zswap

:::info

The details of Midnight's native currency implementation are not yet stable and will
undergo further revisions. The performance of basic operations has not been
optimized at this time.

:::

Zswap[^1] is a shielded token mechanism, based on Zerocash[^2], extended
with *native token support* and *atomic swaps*. Zswap's basic component is
an [offer](#offers), which conceptually is a set of [inputs](#inputs) and
[outputs](#outputs). In this matter, it matches the UTXO model, although the
set of unspent transactions itself is not computable due to the inability to
link matching inputs and outputs, a property inherited from Zerocash.

This section describes a slight variation of Zswap used in Midnight that
permits contracts to hold funds.

## Offers

A Zswap offer consists of four elements:

- a set of [input](#inputs) coins (also called 'spends')
- a set of [output](#outputs) coins
- a set of transient coins
- a balance vector.

Transient coins are coins that are both created and spent in the same
transaction. This may seem superfluous, but it extends the ability for
contracts to manage coins. Conceptually, this is an [output](#outputs)
immediately followed by an [input](#inputs), with the sole distinction that the
input spends from a locally created coin commitment set, as opposed to the
global one, to prevent index collisions.

The balance vector is a vector of the total value of this offer. Its
dimensions are all possible [token types](#token-types), with each dimension
carrying its own value. An input of a given type counts positively towards this
vector and negatively towards an output. A balance vector is considered *balanced* if,
for all dimensions, it is non-negative. Typically, it is *adjusted* before
checking for balance, to account for token mints and fee deductions.

### Outputs

A Zswap output creates a new coin and places a corresponding *commitment* in a
global Merkle tree. It consists of:

- the commitment itself
- a multi-base Pedersen commitment to the type/value vector
- an optional contract address, iff (if and only if) this output is targeted at a contract
- an optional ciphertext, if the output is toward a user that must receive it
- a zero-knowledge proof that the former are correct with respect to each other.

Outputs are valid if their zero-knowledge proof is verified.

### Inputs

A Zswap input spends an existing coin, by referencing (without revealing) its
original commitment in the global Merkle tree and producing a corresponding
(but unlinkable) *nullifier*. It consists of:

- the nullifier itself
- a multi-base Pedersen commitment to the type/value vector
- an optional contract address, iff the output is targeted at a contract
- a Merkle tree of a tree containing the commitment corresponding to the nullifier
- a zero-knowledge proof that the former are correct with respect to each other.

Inputs are valid iff the zero-knowledge proof verifies *and* the Merkle tree
root is in the set of past roots.

### Token types

A token type in Midnight is a 256-bit collision-resistant hash output or the
pre-defined zero value, which represents the native token. Users can issue their own tokens
from contracts, with these token types being derived as a hash of the
contract's address and a domain-separator given by the user.
