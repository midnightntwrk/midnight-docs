Zendoo establishes a parent-child relationship between the mainchain and sidechains, allowing sidechain nodes to observe the mainchain while mainchain nodes only rely on authenticated certificates from sidechain maintainers. The system utilizes ZK Snarks to create a universal verifiable transfer mechanism for sidechains. |

November/2019, ACM CCS 2019                                                                         | The paper introduces Sonic, a ZK Snark that addresses privacy and scalability concerns in cryptocurrencies and other applications. Sonic supports a universal and continually updateable structured reference string that scales linearly in size, making proofs constant size. The verification complexity is comparable to the most efficient Snarks in the literature, particularly in batch verification scenarios.                                                                                                                       |

September/2022, ICCST '22 | The paper explores the incentive distribution in proof trees for Snark-based sidechains with Latus consensus. Game theory instruments are employed to study the stable and efficient block generation process. Two models are considered: one with a single sidechain and another with multiple sidechains, allowing provers to switch between them to maximize their incentives.                                                                                                                                                             |
