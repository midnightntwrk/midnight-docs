# Midnight Network

> Midnight is a zero-knowledge partner chain to Cardano that enables developers to build applications that can selectively hide sensitive information while still allowing public verification of correctness through advanced zero-knowledge cryptography.

Midnight solves the fundamental tension between transparency and privacy in blockchain technology. Unlike traditional blockchains where all transaction data is publicly visible, Midnight allows smart contracts to operate on private data while maintaining security and verifiability.

**Current Status:** Testnet active for development and testing. APIs are in beta (v0.7.0) and breaking changes are possible. Test tokens (tDUST) available via faucet. Block time is 6 seconds.

**Key Technologies:**
- **Compact Programming Language**: TypeScript-based syntax compiled to zero-knowledge circuits for writing privacy-preserving smart contracts
- **Dual-Token System**: NIGHT (native utility token for governance and consensus, 24B supply) and DUST (shielded network resource for transaction fees, decays over time)
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: ZK-SNARKs enable privacy, prevent transaction correlation, and allow selective disclosure
- **Partner Chain Architecture**: Operates as a partner chain to Cardano, inheriting proven security while adding specialized privacy capabilities

**Development Stack:** Smart contracts written in Compact language, DApps built using TypeScript, Proof Server generates zero-knowledge proofs, Midnight Node connects to network, Lace Wallet for browser integration.
