# Circuits

The basic operational element in Compact is the `circuit`. This corresponds
closely to a function in most languages but is compiled directly into a
zero-knowledge circuit. Circuits are declared as:

```compact
circuit c(a: A, b: B, ...): R {
  ...
}

circuit id<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
```

where `A`, `B`, ..., and `R` are types, and `a`, `b` are parameters. The circuit
body itself is a sequence of statements, and each path through the body must end
with a `return` statement, unless the return type is `[]`.
