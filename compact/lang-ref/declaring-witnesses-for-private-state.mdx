# Declaring witnesses for private state

Compact code can call code external to the zero-knowledge circuits to read
and update private state via `witness` functions.

A `witness` function declaration can appear anywhere a `circuit`
definition can appear, including within modules.  A witness function does not
have a body, and its implementation is instead an input to
the contract in the TypeScript target. For instance:

```compact
witness something(x: Boolean): Field;
```

A `witness` function can be called in the same way as a `circuit`.

:::danger

Do not assume in your contract that the code of any `witness` function
is the code that you wrote in your own implementation.  Any DApp may
provide any implementation that it wants for your `witness` functions.
Results from them should be treated as untrusted input.
