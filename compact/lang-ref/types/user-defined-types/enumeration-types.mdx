# Enumeration types

Enumeration types are defined by a declaration beginning with the keyword
`enum`.  Here is an example:

```compact
enum Fruit { apple, pear, plum }
```

An enumeration declaration introduces a named enumeration type, such as `Fruit`
in the example above.  Each enumeration declaration introduces a distinct type.

An enumeration declaration has a sequence of named values separated by commas.
A trailing separator is allowed but not required.

In the example above, the type `Fruit` has three values: `Fruit.apple`,
`Fruit.pear`, and `Fruit.plum`.
