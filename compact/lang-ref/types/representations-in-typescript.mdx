# Representations in TypeScript

Compact's primitive types are represented in TypeScript as follows:

- `Boolean` - `boolean`
- `Field` - `bigint` with runtime bounds checks
- `Uint<n>` / `Uint<0..n>` - `bigint` with runtime bounds checks
- `[T, ...]` - the TypeScript tuple type `[S, ...]` or else the TypeScript array
  type `S[]` with runtime length checks, where `S` is the TypeScript
  representation of the corresponding type `T`
- `Bytes<n>` - `Uint8Array` with runtime length checks
- `Opaque<"string">` - `string`
- `Opaque<"Uint8Array">` - `Uint8Array`

User-defined types are represented in TypeScript as follows:
- `enum` instances - a `number` with runtime membership checks
- `struct` instances with fields `a: A, b: B, ...` - an object `{ a: A, b: B, ... }`
  where `A`, `B`, ... are the TypeScript representations of the Compact types.

Note that other `Opaque` types are currently not supported.
