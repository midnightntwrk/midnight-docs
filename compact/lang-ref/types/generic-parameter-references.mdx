# Generic parameter references

Generic parameters are declared in generic module declarations, generic structure
type declarations, generic circuit definitions, and generic witness declarations.  
For generic modules, they are in scope within the module.
For generic structures, they are in scope for the structure's fields.
For generic circuits, they are in scope in the circuit's
parameters, its return type annotation, and its body.  In
these scopes, a reference to a generic parameter (that is not otherwise shadowed by
some other identifier binding) is either a type or a natural-number size.
