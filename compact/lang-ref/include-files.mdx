# Include files

Compact supports code separation and namespaces through separate files
and modules.  The most basic
of these is the statement

```compact
include "path/to/file";
```

which may appear at the top level of a source file or module. When encountered,
the Compact compiler will search for a Compact source file at
`path/to/file.compact` in the current directory and then 
relative to any of the directories in the
`:`-separated environment variable `COMPACT_PATH`.
This file *must* be found and will be included
verbatim in place of the `include` statement.
