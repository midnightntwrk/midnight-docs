# Ledger state types

In a `ledger` declaration, the following types are valid:

- `T`, for any Compact type `T`
- `Counter`
- `Set<T>`, for any Compact type `T`
- `Map<K, T>`, for any Compact types `K` and `T`
- `Map<K, V>`, for any Compact type `K` and ledger state type `V` (see the following section)
- `List<T>`, for any Compact type `T`
- `MerkleTree<n, T>`, for a compile time integer `1 < n <= 32`, and any Compact
  type `T`
- `HistoricMerkleTree<n, T>`, for a compile time integer `1 < n <= 32`, and any
  Compact type `T`

Each ledger type supports a set of operations, which can be invoked with

```compact
<field name>.<operation>(<arguments ...>)
```

A ledger field that is declared with a Compact type `T` implicitly has the type
`Cell<T>`. `Cell` has operations such as `read`, `write`, and `reset_to_default`.

The `read` and `write` operations for the `Cell` type of any Compact type `T` have syntactic
sugar. If `x` is a field in the ledger of any Compact type, then you may write

```compact
x       // expression equivalent to x.read()
x = val // statement equivalent to x.write(val)
```

The `read`, `increment`, and `decrement` operations of type `Counter` type also
have syntactic sugar.  If `c` is a `Counter` field in the ledger, then you may write

```compact
c        // expression equivalent to c.read()
c += val // statement equivalent to c.increment(val)
c -= val // statement equivalent to c.decrement(val)
```

A comprehensive list of operations can be found in
the Compact [ledger data type documentation](./ledger-adt).
