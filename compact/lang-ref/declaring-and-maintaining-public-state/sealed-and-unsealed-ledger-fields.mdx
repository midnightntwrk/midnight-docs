# Sealed and unsealed ledger fields

Any ledger field can be optionally marked *sealed* by prefixing the
ledger field declaration with the keyword `sealed`.  A sealed field
cannot be set except during contract initialization.  That is, its
value can be modified only by the contract constructor (if any),
either directly within the body of the constructor or via helper
circuits called by the constructor. The `sealed` keyword must come after
the `export` keyword (if present) and before the `ledger` keyword, as
in the following example:

```compact
sealed ledger field1: Uint<32>;
export sealed ledger field2: Uint<32>;

circuit init(x: Uint<32>): [] {
  field2 = x;
}

constructor(x: Uint<16>) {
  field1 = 2 * x;
  init(x);
}
```

It is a static error if a sealed ledger field can be set by any
code that is reachable from an exported circuit.
