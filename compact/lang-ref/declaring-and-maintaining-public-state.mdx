# Declaring and maintaining public state

Compact code can declare public state through `ledger` declarations.

A ledger declaration defines one piece of information the contract
stores in Midnight's public ledger.
Multiple ledger declarations can appear in a program, or none.
They can appear anywhere circuit definitions can appear,
including within modules.

A ledger declaration associates a ledger field name with one of a
set of predefined [ledger ADT types](./declaring-and-maintaining-public-state/ledger-state-types)
For instance:

```compact
ledger val: Field;
export ledger cnt: Counter;
sealed ledger u8list: List<Uint<8>>;
export sealed ledger mapping: Map<Boolean, Field>;
```
