# TypeScript target

When compiled, a contract generates several artifacts. Key to these
are the exported circuits from the contract's top level. These are
divided into two categories: [pure circuits and impure circuits](../circuits/pure-and-impure-circuits).

In the `contract` directory, the semantics of the contract is encoded in
TypeScript, in the form of a `index.cjs` JavaScript implementation file and a
`index.d.cts` type declaration file. For most uses, it is recommended to rely on the
information and interface provided in `index.d.cts`.

For each of the impure circuits, a zero-knowledge prover/verifier key pair is also
generated, as well as instructions for proof generation. These can be found
in the output directory's `keys` and `zkir` subdirectories respectively.
