# Compact Types

Compact is **statically typed**: every expression in a Compact program has a
static type.  Named circuits and witnesses require a type annotation on each of
their parameters, and they require a return type annotation.  Anonymous circuit
expressions can have optional parameter and return type annotations.  Constant
binding statements can have an optional type annotation.

The language is **strongly typed**: the compiler will reject programs that do
not type check.  It will reject programs where a circuit or witness with a
parameter type annotation is called with an incorrectly typed argument for that
parameter.  It will reject programs where a circuit with a return type
annotation returns an incorrectly typed value.  If an optional type annotation
is omitted, the compiler will infer a type and it will reject programs where no
such type can be inferred.

Types consist of built-in primitive types, user-defined types defined in the
program, and generic type parameters in scope.  When the term "type" occurs in
this document without any other qualifier, it means either a primitive type, a
user-defined type, or a generic type parameter in scope.
