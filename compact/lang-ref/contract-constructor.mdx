# Contract constructor

A contract can be initialized via a contract constructor defined at the
program's top level.
The constructor, if any, is typically used to initialize public state
and can also be used to initialize private state through witness
calls.
A constructor can take zero or more arguments.
For example:

```compact
enum STATE { unset, set }
ledger state: STATE;
ledger value: Field;

constructor(v: Field) {
  value = v;
  state = STATE.set;
}
```

At most one contract constructor can be defined for a contract, and it
must appear only at the program top level, i.e., it cannot be defined in
a module.
To initialize ledger fields that are visible only within a module, the
constructor can call a circuit that is exported from the module.
For example:

```compact
module PublicState {
  enum STATE { unset, set }
  ledger state: STATE;
  ledger value: Field;
  export circuit init(v: Field): [] {
    value = v;
    state = STATE.set;
  }
}

import PublicState;

constructor(v: Field) {
  init(v);
}
```
