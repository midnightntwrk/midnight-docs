# Compact reference

Compact is a strongly statically typed, bounded smart contract language, designed to be
used in combination with TypeScript for writing smart contracts for the
three-part structure of Midnight, where contracts have the following
components:
- a replicated component on a public ledger
- a zero-knowledge circuit component, confidentially proving the correctness of
  the former
- a local, off-chain component that can perform arbitrary code

Each contract in Compact can have four kinds of code:
- type declarations, to support all of the following
- declarations of the data that the contract stores in the public ledger
- declarations of `witness` functions, to be supplied in TypeScript
- `circuit` definitions, that serve as the operational core of a smart contract

A contract can also include code from external files, and it can declare and
import modules.

Like TypeScript, Compact is an eager call-by-value language.
