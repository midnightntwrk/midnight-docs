# Expressions


This section describes the syntax of Compact expressions and provides their
static typing rules and their evaluation rules.

The syntax of expressions is given by an EBNF grammar.  We use the following
notational conventions in the grammar:

- Terminals are in <b><tt>bold monospaced</tt></b> font
- Non-terminals are in <em>emphasized</em> font
- Alternation is indicated by a vertical bar (`|`)
- Repetition of zero or more items is indicated by enclosing them in curly
  braces (`{` and `}`)
- Optional items are indicated by enclosing them in square brackets (`[` and
  `]`)

A Compact expression either has a static type, or else it contains a type error.
The static type of an expression, if it has one, is either a Compact type or
else a ledger state type.  If an expression in a program contains a type error,
it means that the Compact compiler will not compile that program.
Subexpressions of Compact expressions are always required to be well-typed
(free from type errors).

Every Compact expression either evaluates to a value, or else it raises an
exception.  The evaluation of an expression is defined in terms of the
evaluation of its subexpressions.  If the evaluation of a subexpression raises
an exception, then the evaluation of the containing expression will stop and
raise the same exception.
