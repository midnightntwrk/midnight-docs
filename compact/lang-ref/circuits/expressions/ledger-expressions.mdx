A Compact program interacts with its public state by invoking operations upon
the ledger or ledger state types.  There are two different forms of ledger
calls.

__Kernel operations__ are operations that do not depend on specific ledger 
state.  They can be invoked by expressions of the form `k.op(e, ...)`, where
`k` is the name of a ledger field declared to have the special ADT type `Kernel`,
`op` is the name of a builtin kernel operation and
`e, ...` is a comma separated sequence of zero or more argument expressions.
The `CompactStandardLibrary` predefines the ledger field name `kernel` to have
ledger type `Kernel`, so for example, the built-in `self` operation can be called
from a circuit as follows:

```compact
import CompactStandardLibrary;
circuit f(): ContractAddress {
  return kernel.self();
}
```

__Ledger ADT operations__ are operations on the program's public ledger state.
They are invoked by expressions of the form `member.op(e, ...)....`,
where `member` is a ledger field name ([declared via a `ledger` field declaration](#declaring-and-maintaining-public-state))
and `.op(e, ...)....` are a sequence of zero or more ledger
ADT operation invocations, where each `op` is the name of a ledger ADT
operation and each `e, ...` is a sequence of zero or more comma-separated
argument expressions.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>ledger</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>ledger-accessor</em></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>|</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>ledger</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>.</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;\{<em>ledger-accessor</em>}</td></tr><tr><td><em>ledger-accessor</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>.</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>(</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;\{<b><tt>,</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em>}]&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>)</tt></b></td></tr></tbody></table>

Note that ledger ADT operations can be chained, because the result of a ledger 
ADT operation might itself have a ledger state type.  Kernel operations cannot
be chained, because the kernel is not a ledger state type and is not returned
by any operation.

The static type of a kernel operation expression is the return type of the
corresponding kernel operation according to the ledger data types reference.

The static type of a ledger ADT operation expression is the return type of the
corresponding ADT operation according to the ledger data types reference.  Note
that this might be a Compact type or it might be a ledger ADT type.  Values of
ledger ADT types can have ADT operations invoked (immediately) on them, but
any other use would be a static type error.

Kernel operations are evaluated by evaluating the argument subexpressions in 
order from left to right and then invoking the corresponding kernel operation
with the argument values.

A ledger ADT operation `member` (that is not followed by a ledger
accessor) is implicitly an invocation of the `read` operation.  It is evaluated
as if it were `member.read()`.

A ledger ADT operation `member.op(e, ...)` is evaluated by evaluating the
argument subexpressions from left to right, and then invoking the operation
`op` on the public ledger member `member` with the argument values.

A ledger ADT operation `adt.op(e, ...)` where `adt` is itself a ledger ADT 
operation is evaluated by first evaluating `adt`, then evaluating the argument
subexpressions from left to right, and then invoking the operation `op` on the
ledger ADT value of `adt` with the argument values.
