Compact has syntax for boolean, numeric, and string literal expressions.

__Boolean literals__ are the reserved words `true` and `false`.
The static type of a boolean literal is `Boolean`.
It evaluates to one of the two boolean values.

__Numeric literals__ are non-negative decimal integers.  They are either the
number `0` or a sequence of digits starting with a non-zero digit.  The static
type of a natural number literal `n` is `Uint<0..n>`.

There is an implementation-defined maximum unsigned integer value.  A numeric
literal larger than this value will have an invalid static type `Uint<0..n>` for
some `n` larger than the maximum unsigned integer.  This expression will be a
static type error unless the literal is smaller than the maximum `Field` value
and is used in a type cast expression of the form `e as Field`.

A natural number literal evaluates to the unsigned integer value that it
denotes.

__String literals__ use TypeScript string literal syntax.  Note that they can
therefore be enclosed in either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes, and they
can contain escaped characters.  Strings are represented by their UTF-8
encoding.  The **length** of a string is the length of its UTF-8 encoding.
The static type of a string literal is `Bytes<n>` where `n` is the length of
the string.
It evaluates to a byte array containing its UTF-8 encoding.

In addition, the expression `pad(n, s)` is a string literal, where
`pad` is a reserved word, `n` is a natural number literal and `s` is a string
literal whose length must be less than or equal to `n`.
The static type of a padded string literal `pad(n, s)` is `Bytes<n>`.
It evaluates to a byte array containing the UTF-8 encoding of `s`, followed by
`0` bytes up to the padded length `n`.
