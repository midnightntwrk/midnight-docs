Compact supports conditional expressions of the form `e0 ? e1 : e2` where `e0`,
`e1`, and `e2` are expressions.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>?</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>:</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

Conditional expressions require the type of `e0` to be `Boolean`.  The types of
`e1` and `e2` must be in the subtype relation.  That is, either the type of
`e1` is a subtype of the type of `e2` or else the type of `e2` is a subtype of
the type of `e1`.

The type of the entire expression is the type of `e2` if `e1` is a subtype of
`e2` and the type of `e1` if `e2` is a subtype of `e1`.

Conditional expressions are evaluated by first evaluating `e0`.  Then, the
value of that expression determines which of the other subexpressions is
evaluated:

- if the value of `e0` is `true`, then `e1` is evaluated and its value is the
  value of the entire expression
- if the value of `e0` is `false`, then `e2` is evaluated and its value is the
  value of the entire expression

The evaluation rules ensure that only one of `e1` and `e2` is evaluated.
