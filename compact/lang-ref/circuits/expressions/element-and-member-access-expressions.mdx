Compact has expressions for accessing the elements of tuple values and the
members of structure values.  An expression of the form `e[n]` where `e` is an
expression and `n` is a numeric literal is a tuple element access.  An
expression of the form `e.id` where `e` is an expression and `id` is the name of
a structure member is a structure member access.

Tuple element accesses are type checked by checking the type of the
subexpression.  It is a type error if this type is not a tuple type `[T, ...]`.
It is a type error if the length of the tuple is less than or equal to the
numeric literal in the expression.  The type of the expression is the
corresponding element type `T` at position `n` in the tuple type.

Tuple element accesses are evaluated by evaluating the subexpression.  The
value of the expression will be the element value at the given zero-based
index.  The subexpression will have a tuple value and the element access will
not be out of bounds, because the expression is well-typed.

Member access expressions are type checked by checking the type of the 
subexpression.  It is a type error if this type is not a structure type.  It is
a type error if the structure type does not contain a member with the same name
as the name in the expression.  The type of the expression is the type of the
corresponding named member of the subexpression's structure type.

Member access expressions are evaluated by evaluating the subexpression.  The
value of the expression will be the member value with the given name.  The
subexpression will have a structure value and the name will exist, because the
expression is well-typed.
