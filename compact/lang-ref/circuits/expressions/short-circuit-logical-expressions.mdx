Compact supports short-circuit logical expressions of the form `e0 op e1`
where `e0` and `e1` are expressions and `op` is one of the logical operators
**or** (`||`) or **and** (`&&`).

Logical expressions require the type of the left subexpression to be `Boolean`.
The type of the right subexpression must be a supertype of `Boolean`.  The only
supertype of `Boolean` is `Boolean` itself.  The entire expression will have the
same type as the type of the right subexpression.

Logical expressions are evaluated by first evaluating the left subexpression.
Then, the value of that expression determines the value of the entire
expression as follows:

- For or, if the value of the left subexpression is `false` then the right
  subexpression is evaluated and its value is the value of the entire
  expression.  Otherwise, the right subexpression is **not** evaluated and the
  value of the left subexpression, implicitly cast to the type of the entire
  expression, is the value of the entire expression.
- For and, if the left subexpression is `true` then the right subexpression is
  evaluated and its value is the value of the entire expression.  Otherwise,
  the right subexpression is **not** evaluated and the value of the left
  subexpression, implicitly cast to the type of the entire expression, is the
  value of the entire expression.
