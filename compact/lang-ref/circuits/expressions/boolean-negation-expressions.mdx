Compact has unary boolean negation expressions of the form `!e` where `e` is an 
expression.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>!</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

A boolean negation expression is type checked by checking the type of the 
subexpression.  It is a type error if this type is not `Boolean`.  The type of
the expression will be `Boolean`.

Negation expressions are evaluated by evaluating the subexpression.  The value
of the expression will be `true` if the value of the subexpression is `false`
and vice versa.  The subexpression will have a boolean value because the
expression is well-typed.
