Tuple values are created with expressions of the form `[e, ...]` where `e, ...`
is a sequence of zero or more comma-separated argument expressions.  A non-empty
sequence can have an optional trailing comma.  The *length* of a tuple is the
number of subexpressions in the tuple creation expression.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>[</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[<em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;\{<b><tt>,</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em>}]&nbsp;&nbsp;[<b><tt>,</tt></b>]&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>]</tt></b></td></tr></tbody></table>

The static type of a tuple creation expression is `[T, ...]` with the number of
types matches length of the tuple and each type `T` is the type of the
corresponding expression.

It is evaluated by evaluating the subexpressions from left to right.  Its value
is a tuple whose length is the number of subexpressions and whose elements are
the subexpression values.
