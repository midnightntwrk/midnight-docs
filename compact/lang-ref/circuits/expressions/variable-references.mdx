The syntax of Compact identifiers is the same as the syntax of TypeScript
identifiers.  A variable is an identifier that is bound as a parameter in a
circuit declaration or else as a constant in a `const` binding statement.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

__Circuit parameters__ are bound by circuit declarations.
The static type of a circuit parameter reference is the declared static type
given by the parameter declaration's type annotation.
It evaluates to the value of the corresponding argument expression that was
passed to the circuit call.

__Constants__ are bound by `const` binding statements.  If the binding statement
has a type annotation, then the constant reference's static type is the declared
static type given by the type annotation, and the type of the right-hand side
initializer expression must be a subtype of the declared type.  If the binding
statement does not have a type annotation, then the constant reference's static
type is the inferred static type (that is, the type of the binding statement's
initializer expression).  A constant reference evaluates to the value of the
binding statement's initializer expression.

Note that constant references can have ledger state types because they can be
initialized with a ledger state type's default value.
