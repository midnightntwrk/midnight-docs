Compact has ledger assignment statements.  They have the form `lhs op e` where
`lhs` is a ledger expression as defined in the section **Ledger expressions**
above, `op` is one of the assignment operators `=` (assignment), `+=` (addition
assignment), or `-=` (subtraction assignment), and `e` is an expression.

<table className="lang-ref-table"><tbody><tr><td><em>expr</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>ledger</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>.</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<em>ledger-accessor</em>}&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>=</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>ledger</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>.</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<em>ledger-accessor</em>}&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>+=</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>→</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>ledger</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>.</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>id</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;{<em>ledger-accessor</em>}&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><tt>-=</tt></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>expr</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

`lhs = e` is shorthand for `lhs.write(e)`.  `lhs += e` is shorthand for
`lhs.increment(e)`.  `lhs -= e` is shorthand for `lhs.decrement(e)`.

Ledger assignment statements are type checked exactly as if they were their
longer equivalent invoking a ledger ADT operation.

They are evaluated exactly as if their longer equivalent were evaluated as a
ledger expression.
