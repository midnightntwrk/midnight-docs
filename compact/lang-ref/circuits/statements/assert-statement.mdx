# `assert` statement

An assertion can be made with

```compact
assert(<expr>, "what constraint was violated");
```

where `<expr>` should evaluate to a `Boolean`. If `<expr>` evaluates to
true, the assertion succeeds; if `<expr>` evaluates to false, it fails
with the given message.  Each assertion is
checked at runtime and constrained in-circuit.
