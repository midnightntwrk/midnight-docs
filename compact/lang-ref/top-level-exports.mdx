# Top-level exports

The circuits exported at the top level of a contract (i.e., not merely exported
from a module) are the entry points of the contract and may not take generic arguments.
Although multiple circuits with the same name are allowed generally to support
[function overloading](../circuits/expressions/circuit-and-witness-calls), it is a static error if more
than one circuit with the same name is exported from the top level.

User-defined types exported from the top level of the main file can be used
to describe the argument and return types of witnesses and exported circuits;
these may accept generic arguments, but generic arguments not actually used as types
are dropped in the exported type.  For example:

```compact
export struct S<#n, T> { v: Vector<n, T>; curidx: Uint<0..n> }
```

is exported for use as a TypeScript type with the `T` parameter but not the `n`
parameter, i.e.,:

```typescript
export type S<T> = { v: T[]; curidx: bigint }
```

Ledger field names exported from the top level are visible for direct inspection
by code outside of the contract via the generated TypeScript `ledger()` function.
